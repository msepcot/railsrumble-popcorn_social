The word \"humbug\" describes deceitful efforts to fool people by pretending to a fake loftiness or false sincerity. So when Scrooge calls Christmas a humbug, he is claiming that people only pretend to charity and kindness in an scoundrel effort to delude him, each other, and themselves. In Scrooge's eyes, he is the one man honest enough to admit that no one really cares about anyone else, so for him, every wish for a Merry Christmas is one more deceitful effort to fool him and take advantage of him. This is a man who has turned to profit because he honestly believes everyone else will someday betray him or abandon him the moment he trusts them.","SPOILER: In the original novel, the Spirit of Christmas Past carries an extinguisher, a small funnel which was used to put out candles.

Dressed in civilian clothes, Andrews and his men traveled by rail into the Southern states. Their mission was to sabotage rail lines and disrupt the Confederate army's supply chain. At the town of Little Shanty, GA, the raiders stole a locomotive known as \"The General.\" They headed north, tearing up track, burning covered bridges and cutting telegraph lines along the way. William Fuller and Jeff Cain, the conductor and engineer of \"The General,\" pursued the stolen train by rail and foot. They first used a hand-cart (as Buster Keaton does in the film), then a small work locomotive called \"The Yonah,\" which they borrowed from a railroad work crew, and finally a full-sized Confederate army locomotive called \"The Texas,\" which pursued \"The General\" for 51 miles - in reverse. During the chase, Confederate soldiers were able to repair the sabotaged telegraph wires and send messages ahead of the raiders. Andrews and his men were intercepted and captured near Chattanooga, TN, by a squad of Confederate troops led by Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest (who, after the war, was one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan). Tried as spies, Andrews and seven of his raiders were hanged (a special gallows was built to hold all eight men). The rest of the raiders were traded in a prisoner exchange. In 1863 the survivors of the mission were awarded the first Medals of Honor (Andrews and the raiders who had been hanged later received the MoH posthumously).","Buster Keaton shot most of this film outdoors in Oregon because the narrow-gauge railroad tracks that could accommodate antique locomotives were still in use at the time.","The film's hard-edged look was inspired by the battlefield photographs of Matthew Brady, which captured the carnage of the Civil War in shocking detail.","This and Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928) were Buster Keaton's last great films.

In all American prints of the movie, the scene ends here. But as originally filmed, the action continues to show the monster grabbing Maria, hurling her into the lake, then departing in confusion when Maria fails to float as the flowers did. This bit was deleted because Karloff - objecting to the director's interpretation of the scene - felt that the monster should have gently put Maria into the lake.

Anobile, Lugosi was originally offered the role of Dr. Frankenstein by original director Robert Florey, but Carl Laemmle insisted that Lugosi play the monster. Test footage of Lugosi in Monster make-up was filmed by Florey on the set of Dracula (1931).

A loud clap of thunder was substituted on the soundtrack. The dialogue was partially restored on the video release, but since no decent recording of the dialogue could be found, it still appears garbled and indistinct. The censored dialog was partially returned to the soundtrack in the initial \"restored version\" releases. Further restoration has now completely brought back this line of missing dialog. A clean recording of the missing dialog was reportedly found on a Vitaphone disc (similar to a large phonograph record). Modern audio technology had to be used to insert the dialog back into the film without any detectable change in the audio quality.","According to the TLC network program \"Hunt for Amazing Treasures\", a unique six-sheet poster for the original 1931 release, showing Karloff as The Monster menacing Mae Clarke, is worth at least $600,000 US and is possibly the most valuable movie poster in the world.

Although wet and tired, she agreed to do one last take of the scene, the one that appears in the finished film, after director James Whale promised her anything she wanted if she would do so. She asked for a dozen hard-boiled eggs, her favorite snack. Whale gave her two dozen. The DVD commentary for the film suggests that Harris wasn't actually a good swimmer, quoting Harris as saying that she had only a couple of swimming lessons before filming and had never dived under water before.","John Huston wrote an early version of the warning speech given at the start of the film.","The method of animating the creature is never discussed in Mary Shelley's novel. In the book, Frankenstein, narrating, refuses to divulge how he did it so no one can re-create his actions. However, the use of lightning to resurrect the monster has become the accepted methodology and appears in virtually every Frankenstein movie since.","According to The People's Almanac, at one point the movie was to have included a line of dialogue giving the Monster the name, Adam. The Almanac indicates that an early print of this film may have indeed been released with just such a scene, but that it was cut when audiences began referring to the Monster by the name Frankenstein.","John Carradine, who later played Dracula in the Universal horror films, once claimed he was considered for the role of the Monster.","The Monster in this film does not physically resemble Mary Shelley's character. It was make-up artist Jack P. Pierce who came up with innovations such as the Monster's flat head, the bolts through the neck, the droopy eyelids, and the poorly-fitted suit. Any future Frankenstein film that features any of these physical abnormalities is taking its inspiration from Pierce's make-up work.","The popular image of Frankenstein's monster as green-skinned was sourced in this film. Actually, Jack P.

In an interview conducted shortly before his death, Van Sloan remembered that Lugosi's makeup resembled The Golem, with a large broad wig and \"a polished clay-like skin.\" Unfortunately, no footage of the test or any photographs of Lugosi in this makeup are known to exist.","The movie's line \"It's alive!

Whale said he did so because he wanted to get away from the war pictures with which he had so far been associated. Ironically, Whale is now, by far, best-remembered for his four horror films.","The casting of the monster was the most difficult aspect of the casting process. James Whale happened to spot Boris Karloff in the Universal commissary and passed him a note offering a screen-test, which Karloff jumped at. Karloff later joked that he was offended by being viewing as such an ugly character, since on the day that Whale spotted him, he was wearing his most elegant suit and thought he was looking handsome.","Edward Van Sloan (Dr Waldman) also makes an uncredited appearance as himself in the film's prologue, in order to warn audiences of what follows.","The monster make-up design by Jack P.

When the cast was assembled to travel to the location, Marilyn ran from her car directly up to Karloff, who was in full make-up and costume, took his hand and asked \"May I drive with you?\" Delighted, and in typical Karloff fashion, he responded, \"Would you, darling?\" She then rode to the location with \"The Monster.\".","Extant copies of the 1938 re-issue trailer show The Monster rising from the operating table and stalking away after strangling Dr. Waldman.

Among the unconfirmed cast members are John Ford, who claimed to have played a Klansman riding with one hand holding up his hood over one eye so he could see better. Such a Klansman is visible in the film and may indeed have been Ford. Despite frequently being credited as a \"Piedmont Girl\", actress Bessie Love denied claims that she ever appeared in this film. Erich von Stroheim for years claimed to be the stunt man who falls from a roof (breaking two ribs in the process), but assistant director Joseph Henabery strongly denied that von Stroheim was ever on a D.W.

However, postwar reconstruction scenes were not historically accurate, and many were in fact based on political cartoons rather than photographs (such as the legislature scenes).","The original budget for the film was $40,000, but D.W. Griffith spent $110,000, the largest amount ever spent on a film up to that time.","The original title \"The Clansman\" was jettisoned for being too tame given the breadth and scope of the subject matter.","The film was 12 reels long.","During filming, camera operator Karl Brown was sure that the movie was just another typical melodrama. At the film's premiere, D.W. Griffith had hired the entire Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra to play the score for the film. Brown was amazed; nothing like this has been done before. When the conductor raised his baton, and the orchestra started playing, he said it was so amazing and loud he was shaking his head, \"It was like nothing I ever heard.\" Brown additionally remembers that Griffith hummed certain themes to the composer of the original score that he wanted.","Each major character in the film had a particular musical theme, to be played by either an orchestra or a theater organ during theatrical engagements. While D.W. Griffith was choosing musical themes for the characters, he allowed Lillian Gish to choose her own, or Elsie Stoneman's, theme.

In fact, audiences loved the actor's performance so much so that D.W. Griffith tried to track him down, supposedly to no avail. Some filmographies credit William Freeman in this role. Gish corroborates this credit in her autobiography, writing that she met Freeman years later when she was riding in a parade.","Future directors John Ford, Raoul Walsh, Elmer Clifton, Joseph Henabery, Karl Brown and Donald Crisp worked on this film as actors and/or crew members. Erich von Stroheim is also credited by some sources - including von Stroheim himself - with being an actor and/or assistant director on this film, but records show that the first time von Stroheim worked for D.W.

The film will be shown at the Sonotone Theater, starting Friday.\"","Historian Kevin Brownlow has expressed doubt concerning'Fireworks' Wilson' whom Karl Brown, the assistant cameraman, named as the special effects man in interviews. Brownlow's doubt is caused by the fact that there are no references to Wilson in any other accounts from any period, and he has suggested that Brown may have invented the name since he could not recall the name of the film's documented special effects supervisor, Walter Hoffman.","Because of the lax accounting methods of its distributors, it was difficult to determine how much the film actually made at the box office. As a result, those connected with its making ludicrously exaggerated its box office take (Lillian Gish wrote in her autobiography that it made over $100 million). Its actual take is now estimated to be about $10 million, still a fantastic sum for its time.","Due to the chaotic nature of film distribution of the time, numerous fortunes were made on this film by men who had nothing to do with the actual production. Louis B. Mayer was one such beneficiary, who obtained state's right distribution rights for the film on the east coast and the profits allowed him to launch Louis B. Mayer Productions, which soon relocated to Los Angeles.","After this film was released and criticized as being racist, D.W. Griffith was very hurt. He decided to make Intolerance: Love&#x27;s Struggle Throughout the Ages (1916) as a follow-up, to show how damaging and dangerous people's intolerance can be.","It is widely believed that after viewing this film in the White House, President Woodrow Wilson remarked that it was \"like writing history with lightning.\" However, the reality is that Wilson disapproved of the \"unfortunate production\". It is believed by some of Wilson's aides that the apparent endorsement and approbation was a ruse generated by Thomas Dixon, the author of the original novel.","Ironically, the release of the film inspired many African-Americans to start making their own films in an attempt to counter this film's depiction of them and to offer positive alternative images and stories of the African-American people.","The NAACP attempted to have this film banned. After that effort failed, it then attempted to have some of the film's more extreme scenes censored.","Some of the investors were Louis B. Mayer, H.E. Aitken and Jesse L.

He said it sounded all right, but he wanted to hear his wife's opinion. He phoned her from the office and she told him to stay and play himself and send Walker home to her.","When Jerome Kern was told that MGM wanted to make a movie of his life he told them that, frankly, his life had been so boring they would have trouble making an interesting movie from it. In order to add some drama, the writers invented the Hesslers and especially the hunt for Sally Hessler.","Judy Garland, who played real-life singer-dancer Marilyn Miller, was pregnant with her first daughter, Liza Minnelli.

At Miss Lansbury's insistence, producer Arthur Freed, who already had overseen The Harvey Girls (1946), allowed her, in this Jerome Kern biopic, to use her own singing voice in the jaunty, set-on-swings production number, \"How'd You Like to Spoon with Me?\" (lyrics by Edward Laska).","This was the second of six MGM movies released between 1944 and 1953 featuring June Allyson and Van Johnson, although in this film they did not share any scenes or musical numbers.","Not all the singers in the film were featured on the 78-rpm soundtrack album released by MGM Records.

Hitchcock wanted the image to evoke the old-fashioned, heavily mustached villain found in many silent films. He later called this touch \"my farewell to silent pictures\".","Much of the film was originally shot silent; when sound became available during the course of shooting, director Alfred Hitchcock re-shot certain scenes with sound, thus making it the Master of Suspense's first talkie. There was one complication with this change, however. Leading lady Anny Ondra had a thick German accent which was inappropriate to her character, Alice White. Joan Barry was chosen to provide a different voice for her, but post-production dubbing technology did not exist then. The solution was for Barry to stand just out of shot and read Alice's lines into a microphone as Ondry mouthed them in front of the camera. This is generally acknowledged as the first instance of one actor's voice being dubbed by another, even though the word \"dub\" is technologically inappropriate in this case.","Generally acknowledged as the first British talkie, and definitely the first sound-on-film British talkie.

Alfred Hitchcock thought that this was an absurd idea and so he secretly filmed the whole thing with sound.","The light levels in the British Museum were insufficient to allow Hitchcock to film the final chase scene in the museum. Without informing the producer, Alfred Hitchcock used the Schufftan process (developed by German cinematographer Eugen Sch&#xFC;fftan). This involved taking still photos of the interior of the museum, then reflecting the photos in a mirror with certain parts of the silvering of the mirror scraped away to allow people (entering a door, for example) to be filmed through the mirror so that they appeared to be present in the museum (in later years, American development of traveling matte and other process photography methods largely replaced the Shufftan process).","Alfred Hitchcock filmed the silent version with Sam Livesey as the Chief Inspector, but when filming the sound version replaced Livesey with Harvey Braban.","Michael Powell claims to have suggested the use of The British Museum as the location for the final pursuit, thus beginning Alfred Hitchcock's use of famous landmarks in his \"chase\" films.","As Tracy (Donald Calthrop) sits eating some food which he has just gained in a first minor act of blackmail, he sits humming the tune \"The Best Things in Life are Free\"."],"tt0043759":["This was June Haver's only full-length film in black and white.

Budd Schulberg was captivated by the subject matter, devoting years of his life to absorbing everything he could about the milieu. He became a regular fixture on the waterfront, hanging out in West Side Manhattan and Long Island bars, interviewing longshore-union leaders and getting to know the outspoken priests from St Xavier's in Hell's Kitchen.","On the Waterfront (1954) is widely known to be an act of expiation on the part of Elia Kazan for naming names to HUAC during the Joseph McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s. What is less widely reported is that Kazan intended it as a direct attack at his former close friend Arthur Miller who had been openly critical of Kazan's actions. Specifically, it was a direct response to Miller's play The Crucible.","Elia Kazan was loath to do business with Darryl F. Zanuck who had insisted on multiple cuts on Man on a Tightrope (1953). Fortunately when Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg met with Zanuck, he started talking about widescreen Technicolor pictures. Zanuck eventually came clean and said he didn't like a single thing about it, stating \"Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?\" This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer Sam Spiegel who set up a deal with Columbia.","Sam Spiegel sent the script to Marlon Brando and it came back with a refusal. Spiegel however had inserted small pieces of paper between the pages which were still in place when the script was returned to him, indicating that it hadn't been read. While Spiegel continued to work on Brando, Frank Sinatra agreed to take on the role.","The original title was simply \"Waterfront\" until Columbia learned that there was a television series by that name.","The part of Terry Malloy was originally written for John Garfield who died before the film was made.","According to Marlon Brando's friend, Carlo Fiore, and his reminiscences in his book \"Bud: The Brando I Knew\", it was Fiore who helped make some key decisions about the famous taxi cab scene. It wasn't working to Brando's satisfaction, and the actor was becoming increasingly frustrated at being unable to find the truth about the scene. Fiore told him that having a gun pulled on him by his brother would hit a bullshit note with Terry, and that shocked disbelief that his brother would do such a thing would be the most appropriate response. Brando then went into a stormy conference with Elia Kazan and Sam Spiegel before nailing the scene. Afterwards Kazan drew Fiore aside and said \"Next time you get an idea about a scene, bring it to me, not Marlon, okay?\" There is some doubt about the veracity of this story however as one look at the original script reveals that shocked surprise was Terry's reaction all along.","Sam Spiegel forgot to pay for rear-projection equipment, hence the reason why the cab where Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger play out the film's most famous scene has blinds.","As part of his contract, Marlon Brando only worked till 4 every day and then he would leave to go see his analyst.

Elia Kazan approached Sinatra about the part but producer Sam Spiegel favored Marlon Brando for his greater pulling power at the box office.","According to Arthur Miller in his autobiography \"Timebends\", he had written a screenplay dealing with corruption on the New York waterfront called \"The Hook\". Elia Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they went to see Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make \"The Hook\", but his minions were troubled by the portrayal of corrupt union officials. When Cohn asked that the antagonists of the script be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent Miller a letter telling him it was interesting that he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie pro-American. This film, which did include corrupt union officials, was based on articles by Malcolm Johnson. Kazan asked Miller to write the script, but he declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Budd Schulberg, a fellow HUAC informer, developed the story and wrote the script. The movie was produced by Sam Spiegel and distributed by Columbia, which had turned down \"The Hook\".","Marlon Brando did not initially want the role of Terry Malloy after producer Sam Spiegel offered it to him because he was disgusted with Elia Kazan's friendly testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Spiegel, who had originally offered the role to Hoboken native Frank Sinatra, who had enthusiastically accepted, then tried to interest Montgomery Clift in the part. Spiegel wanted a bigger box-office attraction than Sinatra, who eventually filed a lawsuit against Spiegel for breach of contract when Brando did sign for the part.","The taxicab scene between Terry and Charlie, one of the most famous scenes in the cinema, was not improvised, as Marlon Brando claimed in his autobiography. When Brando did initially improvise during the shooting of the scene, and Rod Steiger followed his lead, Elia Kazan yelled, \"Stop the shit, Buddy!\" to Brando, using his nickname. The two actors stuck to Budd Schulberg's script after that.","Marlon Brando objected to certain aspects in the famous taxicab scene. When filming began, Brando began to improvise some dialogue, surprising Rod Steiger. After a while, Elia Kazan told Brando to \"knock it off\". The problem Brando had with the scene, as he explained to screenwriter Budd Schulberg and Kazan, was that he felt he (as Terry Malloy) would have difficulty trying to talk reasonably with his brother (played by Steiger) with a gun at his ribs. At this, Kazan agreed and told Brando to improvise. Kazan maintained that he did not direct Brando nor Steiger in this scene, he simply stood back and let the two actors direct themselves.","Marlon Brando was paid $100,000, Elia Kazan received $100,000 plus 25% of the box office.","The script was originally turned down by Darryl F. Zanuck at Twentieth Century Fox on the grounds that the gritty drama didn't fit well with the policy at the time of creating lavish productions for the studio's Cinemascope format.","Marlon Brando's Oscar for Best Actor was either lost or stolen.

In 1979 Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.","In 1955, screenwriter Budd Schulberg - who won an Oscar for his screenplay - published his novel \"Waterfront\", which focuses on the causes of waterfront corruption and elucidates the involvement of the shipping companies, the mayor's office, police, and the church.","Shortly after the film's debut in 1954, the AFL-CIO expelled the East Coast longshoremen's union because it was still run by the mob.","In 1955, Anthony \"Tony Mike\" de Vincenzo filed a lawsuit against Columbia Pictures because Terry Malloy (the character played by Marlon Brando) seemed to have been based on him, who was known as a whistle-blower against the corrupt International Longshoremen's Association union. He won a small out-of-court settlement.","When Elia Kazan and his original screenwriter Arthur Miller originally showed the script to Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn, Columbia executives objected to the script as being \"atni-union\", as they feared union retaliation. Cohn recommended that union officials be changed to communists.","The leading characters were based on real people: Terry Malloy was based on longshoreman and whistle-blower Anthony De Vincenzo; Father Barry was based on waterfront priest John M.

Although Montgomery was fine in her screen test, there was something well-bred about her that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie, who was raised on the waterfront in Hoboken, NJ. He gave the part to Saint, and she went on to win cinematic immortality, and a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, in the part.","Although the part of Edie Doyle properly is a lead, producer Sam Spiegel listed Eva Marie Saint as a Supporting Actress in the hopes of getting her a nomination. The ploy worked, and she won the Oscar.","The DVD version of the film has a Special Features section which shows some of the original promotional posters which state that the film is about \"the redemption of Terry Malone\".

Their major disagreement is over the behavior of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Horner argues that T-Rex was a scavenger, while Bakker insists that T-Rex must have been a predator. Horner reportedly asked to have Burke eaten by the T-Rex in this film.

O&#x27;Brien, who earlier used stop-motion animation of dinosaur models in The Lost World (1925), had created several dinosaur models for his unfinished production Creation (1931). Producer Merian C. Cooper sold the idea for King Kong (1933) to RKO executives in New York by showing them a test sequence using O'Brien's models. The executives were stunned, never having seen anything like it, and green-lighted production of King Kong (1933). O'Brien also used many of his \"Creation\" models in King Kong (1933), including the T-Rex and the pteranodon (giant flying creature).","The project went through numerous title changes during production, including \"The Beast\" (original title of draft by Edgar Wallace in RKO files), \"The Eighth Wonder\", \"The Ape\", \"King Ape\" and \"Kong\".","Both Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack had been wrestlers, and they acted out the fighting moves for the battle between the T-Rex and Kong in the effects studio, before the animators shot the scene.","This film was successfully reissued worldwide numerous times; some claim it was the first ever re-released film. In the 1938 reissue, several scenes of excessive violence and sex were cut to comply with the Production Code enforced in 1934. Though many of the censored scenes were restored by Janus Films in 1971 (including the censored sequence in which Kong peels off Fay Wray's clothes), one deleted scene has never been found, shown publicly only once during a preview screening in San Bernardino, California in January 1933. It was a graphic scene following Kong shaking four sailors off the log bridge, causing them to fall into a ravine where they were eaten alive by giant spiders. At the preview screening, audience members screamed and either left the theatre or talked about the grisly sequence throughout the subsequent scenes, disrupting the film. Said the film's producer, Merian C. Cooper, \"It stopped the picture cold, so the next day back at the studio, I took it out myself.\"","The trees and plants in the background on the stop-motion animation sets were a combination of metal models and real plants. One day during filming, a flower on the miniature set bloomed without anyone noticing. The error in continuity was not noticed until the film was developed and shown. While Kong moved, a time-lapse effect showed the flower coming into full bloom, and an entire day of animation was lost.","King Kong's roar was a lion's and a tiger's roar combined and run backwards.","Scenes cut over the years of release and re-release: Kong chewing on the natives of Skull Island; two scenes with Kong squashing one native each with his giant foot; the brontosaurus biting and throwing the men in the water; Kong putting a New Yorker in his mouth then throwing him down to the ground; a scene where Kong climbs a building, pulls out a sleeping woman with his giant hand, examines her, and when he finds it's not Ann Darrow, tosses her down to the sidewalk below; and, of course, Fay Wray's clothing being peeled off. The censor committee once stated that this was at least six minutes of editing. These scenes were all restored to the actual film in 1971. Of course, we still have yet to see the famous spider pit sequence, although in King Kong (2005), we get an idea of what it was like.

Cooper had a dream about a massive gorilla attacking New York City.","Was voted the 47th Greatest Film of all time by Entertainment Weekly.","Edgar Wallace died in Hollywood in February 1932 while working on the story for this film.","There was more than one model of Kong used in the film. There are considerable differences between the Kong on Skull Island and the Kong in New York. For instance, the Skull Island Kong has a longer face, which the filmmakers thought made the ape look \"too human\".","In his review in The New York Times (3 March 1933), film critic Mordaunt Hall incorrectly refers to Fay Wray's character as \"Ann Redman\".","Jean Harlow refused the lead part.","The laserdisc edition of the film includes the first ever audio commentary.","Merian C. Cooper was partially inspired by W. Douglas Burden, who brought the world's first captive Komodo dragons to the Bronx Zoo in 1926. Cooper was intrigued how the once mythic, massive predators quickly perished once caged and displayed for the public.","As a child, Merian C. Cooper lived close to an elevated train which kept him awake at night when it clattered across the tracks. This was the inspiration for the scene where Kong destroys an elevated train.","The two-legged lizard that attacks Jack Driscoll was actually meant to be an aetosaur, a reptile from the Triassic Period. However, because of the high price of armatures (the metal skeletons for the puppets), RKO cut costs by not having hind legs made for it. As a result, the aetosaur has two forearms, no hind legs and a snakelike appearance.","Fay Wray claimed that she personally insisted that her character be a blond, and personally chose her wig at the Max Factor shop in Los Angeles.","Sensing a huge hit from industry buzz, MGM offered to buy the film outright from RKO for $1.072m (some $400,000 over its negative cost), figuring the little studio was reeling from losing $10+m in 1932. RKO was smart to decline the offer. The film smashed attendance records nationwide and ended up grossing $1.761m during its initial release. RKO would periodically, and extremely profitably, re-release the movie through the 1950s.","Jungle scenes were filmed on the same set as the jungle scenes in The Most Dangerous Game (1932), which also happened to star Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong.","Art drawn for the press book associated for the original release of the film was contributed to by actor Keye Luke, who was a highly regarded illustrator before he became an actor and whose works have appeared in films themselves, such as The Shanghai Gesture (1941).","The 2005 DVD restoration further details the risqué liberties of a 1933 pre-code film release in two scenes. The first is when Ann is on the ship's deck while Charlie is peeling potatoes, and the second is where Denham is shooting some test footage of Ann (\"Scream for your life, Ann, Scream!\"). The thin material used for Ann's dress and gown in both scenes makes it obvious that Fay Wray is not wearing a bra; a wardrobe decision that may not have made it past the Breen Code the following year.","Executive Producer David O. Selznick left RKO midway through production of this film. But Selznick's last act of business at RKO - and probably his biggest contribution to the film - was to write a memo changing the name of the production from'Kong' to King Kong (1933).","According to the book \"David O. Selznick's Hollywood\" by Ron Haver, costume designer Walter Plunkett (later noteworthy for Gone with the Wind (1939)) worked uncredited on this film. Specifically, he designed the \"Beauty and the Beast\" costume that Ann Darrow wears while Carl Denham is filming her screen test.","Ranked #4 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre \"Fantasy\" in June 2008.","To keep in line with the use of most of the cast from The Most Dangerous Game (1932) the role of Jack Driscoll was intended for Joel McCrea. According to Fay Wray however, McCrea's agents demanded more money so the role was given to Bruce Cabot.","It has been said that King Kong (1933) was the first Hollywood film to use a fully symphonic musical score. As memorable and effective as the musical score was, some have made the same claim about RKO's Bird of Paradise (1932), released earlier. (Perhaps that claim should be revised to \"the first memorable film...\") Regardless, Max Steiner, composer for both films (and many later classics, including Gone with the Wind (1939) and Casablanca (1942)) was a visionary, forward thinking man. One of the legends surrounding this film is that director Merian C. Cooper paid Steiner from his own pocket after RKO bosses expressed concern over mounting production costs.","The character of Carl Denham was inspired by the film's director, Merian C. Cooper. Both Robert Armstrong, who portrayed Carl Denham and Merian C. Cooper died on consecutive days, 4/20/73 and 4/21/73.","When describing Kong to Fay Wray, Merian C.

We see a pristine picture of the Empire State Building as it existed in the 50s with its' TV Antenna. In the original scenes the NYC landmark was part of \"Hollywood Set\", with aerial footage added.","The \"Old Arabian Proverb\" opening the film was actually written by director Merian C.

This was accomplished by adding Kong in post-production, falling towards the ground. Real footage of the building was used, but when the producers watched the scene they realized that viewers could see through Kong, especially as he passed the darker ledges, so it was cut.

Beatty says that partially the reason why he had the fruit in his hand was that the moment he squeezed the fruit was supposed to signal the make up artist to pull the line and rip the scalp off. However, when the scene was being filmed, the artist was so nervous that he forgot to pull the line. By the same token, Faye Dunaway mentions that the make up artists also put appliances over her face that were also wired so that when she was being shot they would yank off the flesh colored covers.","In the Special Edition DVD Documentary, Estelle Parsons says she was the only member of the cast who actually researched the history of the Barrow Gang. She also says that early in the filming, she wanted to meet the real Blanche Barrow but Warren Beatty, in his capacity as the producer, was against the idea. Finally, after a week, Warren relented and set up a meeting with Blanche, but at that point Parsons lost interest and never met Blanche. In fact, Warren Beatty brought the script to Blanche for her to read for her approval before she would give permission to use her name. She agreed the script was factual and approved it. While there he played her piano and sang for her. She was very fond of Warren even though the director completely changed the script to make her look as in her own words, \"A screaming Horse's Ass.\" She took her third husband Eddie to see the movie with her for the first time and nearly died of embarrassment.","Future film maker Curtis Hanson, who began his career as a photographer, took a series of modeling photos of Faye Dunaway which helped to get her the job as Bonnie Parker.

After viewing the photos, Dunaway was cast. According to Hanson, Warren Beatty wanted to pay him for the photos but Hanson instead asked to accompany them to Texas so he could observe the filming to which Beatty agreed.","Screen writer Robert Towne did uncredited work as a story consultant on the movie. He is featured in interviews for the Special Edition DVD Documentary.","Near the end of the film, Bonnie and Clyde are lying in bed discussing marriage. It is interesting to note that in real life, Bonnie was already married. She had married her high school sweetheart, Roy Thorton before meeting Clyde. Thorton was a petty criminal who was sent to prison for life for murder. Despite his conviction, Bonnie never divorced him and to the day she died, Bonnie Parker was officially \"Mrs. Roy Thorton\". Bonnie was still wearing Thornton's ring when she was killed.","In real life Blanche Barrow did not run from the Joplin apartment screaming with a spatula. In fact she helped Clyde push one of the police cars out of the driveway which was down hill. The car started rolling faster and rolled across the street into a large tree. They both were dragged by the momentum and that is what witnesses saw. Clyde was shot at that time and Blanche let out one yelp and kept moving to get out of the line of fire. That was about the last shot since the officer shooting ran out of ammo so Buck called her back and she returned to get into the escape car in front of the apartment rather than being picked up down the street as the movie portrayed.","The characters Eugene Grizzard and Velma Davis (played by Gene Wilder and Evans Evans) are based on Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone of Ruston, Louisiana.

After driving around Ruston for several hours, Darby and Stone were released unharmed. During the drive, when Darby mentioned that he was an undertaker, Bonnie Parker remarked, \"Well, maybe you'll work on me someday.\" A year later, Darby did just that. He was one of the undertakers who worked on Bonnie Parker's body after she and Clyde Barrow were killed in the roadside ambush near Gibsland, Louisiana, in May, 1934.","Half a dozen of the cars used in the movie, including the one stolen from Gene Wilder's character were loaned to the studio by a private owner who specialized in the restoration of Model A's, Roadsters, and Model T's, Mr. Seng of Castro Valley, California. His only requirement in loaning the studio his cars was that they were not to be shot up.","Before deciding to play the role himself, producer Warren Beatty's first choice for the role of Clyde Barrow was musician and composer Bob Dylan, who resembled the actual Barrow more strongly than Beatty.","Warren Beatty wanted to produce this movie in black and white. This was rejected by Warner Brothers.","Co-writer Robert Benton got the idea for his script from his father who had actually attended the separate funerals of Parker and Barrow.","According to the film's editor Dede Allen, the climactic massacre was meant to evoke Abraham Zapruder's footage of John F.

Moss parallel parks the getaway car while Clyde and Bonnie are in the bank, and then has trouble getting the car out of the space, is based on a true event, but it didn't happen to Bonnie and Clyde. It occurred on June 10, 1933; the bank robbers in question were John Dillinger and William Shaw, and the driver was Paul \"Lefty\" Parker. This is documented in Bryan Burrough's \"Public Enemies: American's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34\", upon which the film Public Enemies (2009) was based.","Leading Newsweek film critic Joseph Morgenstern hated the film when he first saw it, but then later took the unprecedented step of admitting that his original review was completely wrong. His revised version raved about the film.","Unusually for such a graphic and violent film, Arthur Penn intended it to be partly comic, almost like a send-up of the 1930s era gangster films.","Heavily influenced by the French New Wave directors, mainly through its rapid shifts of tone and its choppy editing.","Warren Beatty really wanted his then lover Natalie Wood to play the part of Bonnie Parker but Wood wanted to concentrate on her therapy at the time.

The director agreed only on condition that he could make some important changes, the main one being making Clyde impotent as opposed to bisexual.","A screening for Jack L.

Warner initially dumped the film into drive-in and second run theaters and apparently went to his grave still hating the film.","Michael J. Pollard admitted in later interviews that he borrowed his accent from Bob Dylan on the \"Blonde on Blonde\" album.","Veteran cinematographer Burnett Guffey - an Oscar-winner From Here to Eternity (1953) - had frequent arguments with Arthur Penn over his radical shooting style. Ironically Guffey went on to win another Oscar for his work on Bonnie and Clyde (1967).","At the time, this was Warner Brothers' second highest grossing film, after My Fair Lady (1964).","Arthur Penn was particularly fascinated with the way Akira Kurosawa handled violent action and death in his films. In particular, he drew on Kurosawa's balancing of slow motion and real time that he employed in Seven Samurai (1954).","Costume designer Theadora Van Runkle had to deal with Warren Beatty's worries (6'4\") that he would be upstaged by Faye Dunaway (who stood 5'7\"). This is why Van Runkle kept Dunaway in flat shoes throughout the film.","The real Blanche Barrow sued Warner Brothers over the way she was depicted in the film. In reality, Barrow was the same age as Bonnie Parker, arguably better looking than her, she was not a preacher's daughter and had married Buck knowing full well that he was an escaped prisoner and twice divorced.","Once Warren Beatty came on board, one of the first things deleted from Robert Benton and David Newman's script was a homosexual affair between Clyde and Moss.","In real life, by the time Clyde Barrow died at the age of 24, he had been responsible - both directly and indirectly - for the deaths of at least 14 people.","Originally writers Robert Benton and David Newman wrote Clyde Barrow as a bisexual, a point which they felt was non-negotiable. Warren Beatty had no objections but Arthur Penn did. He felt that to have Clyde be part gay on top of all the other social dysfunctions featured in the film would just make the audience think they were watching a bunch of freaks.

Guffey was mindful that a vast majority of studio profits then came from drive-in theaters. Underlit scenes simply didn't show up well on those screens. Matters rose to the extent that Guffey quit the film for a week but ultimately came back (and won the Academy Award).","One of Arthur Penn's intentions was to make the character of Blanche as hysterical as possible so that it would make Bonnie look even cooler.","Michael J. Pollard didn't realize in eating scenes that you don't actually eat all the food because of the possibility of repeated takes. Sure enough, he soon regretted it in the scene in which the outlaws kidnap a couple and eat their lunch in the car. By the 12th take, Pollard was feeling decidedly ill, having had to eat 12 whole hamburgers.","Bonnie's family reunion near the end was shot through a window screen to give it a hazy, nostalgic effect.","Many consider one of the reasons why the film was so successful was because of its anti-establishment stance. At the time, disillusionment with America's involvement in Vietnam was gaining ground.","Cinematographer Burnett Guffey was dismissed during this production due to artistic clashes with director Arthur Penn (Guffey wanted more light - Penn wanted a more subdued tone). In the meantime, veteran cinematographer Ellsworth Fredericks replaced Guffey, but only for a brief period. Penn, realizing that he'd misjudged Guffey, ultimately reinstated him and Guffey went on to win a second Oscar for Best Cinematography for his efforts.","SPOILER: For the climactic massacre, Faye Dunaway's leg had to be tied to the gear shift to prevent her from falling completely out of the rocking car","SPOILER: The car that the real Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow met their fate in is on display (along with Barrow's bullet-riddled shirt) in Primm Valley Hotel and Casino in Primm, NV, 20 miles outside of Las Vegas near the California border.

The Planet Hollywood in Dallas closed in 2001 and the car is now owned by a private collector.","SPOILER: Contrary to the film's portrayal of Blanche Barrow inadvertently divulging the identity of C.W. Moss to Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, thereby setting Bonnie and Clyde's deaths in motion, in real life Hamer found Bonnie and Clyde through simple tracking methods. Hamer knew that they traveled in a loop. They would routinely start in Dallas, move north through Oklahoma and Kansas, cut east to Missouri, south to Arkansas and Louisiana, and west back to Dallas. Knowing that gang member Henry Methvin (on whom the C.W. Moss character is partly based) had family in Louisiana, Hamer struck a deal with Methvin's father (as seen in the movie) to set up Bonnie and Clyde.","SPOILER: The final moment of the field shoot out in which the posse surrounds a dying Buck and a hysterical Blanche is based on the rare \"action\" photo taken of that moment. In actuality, Blanche was screaming at an officer who had his foot on Buck's wounded head and a gun to his face threatening to shoot him again. She was begging him not to shoot him again because he was already dying.","SPOILER: The ending of the film was quite romanticized in comparison to the real-life couple's death. In the film, Clyde stops his car on a country road to help a friend change a flat tire. Once they realize the friend has set them up, the bank-robbing duo look at each other lovingly, and make a desperate attempt to be in each other's arms once more before being cut down by machine-gun fire. In reality, Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed just outside Gibsland, Louisiana, on May 23, 1934. They did not get out of their car, which was raked by 187 shells. Clyde had been driving in his socks, and Bonnie had a sandwich in her mouth.","SPOILER: The infamous climactic shoot-out was filmed with four different cameras, all running at different speeds. The scene itself lasts 54 seconds.","SPOILER: In reality, Buck Barrow's death was much more brutal. After being shot repeatedly, a police officer stepped on his face and was about to deliver the killer shot before Blanche's screaming alerted him to what he was actually doing.","SPOILER: In real life, Clyde Barrow was a highly dangerous marksman who had mastered most firearms including the Browning Automatic Rifle and the Thompson Sub Machine Gun. The lawmen chasing him were well aware of his ability with a gun which partly explains the ruthlessness behind the way he was gunned down.","SPOILER: Gene Hackman regretted his decision to film Buck's death scene in his vest.

Lestrade), and subsequent lines, he clearly has a rather heavy *Brooklyn* accent, and seen in other shots during the scene does not in any way resemble Daniell, and the momentary appearance to the contrary is clearly an optical illusion.","The fourth of fourteen films based on Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional consulting detective Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson.","The set used for Professor Moriarty's hide out was used as a pub/bar in Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942).","One of several titles in the Sherlock Holmes series whose original copyrights were apparently not renewed and have thereby fallen into public domain; as a result, seriously inferior copies are presently being offered by a number of VHS and DVD dealers who do not have access to original studio masters.","This was the second Sherlock Holmes feature to be produced at Universal.

Bernstein had just had some success with his jazz score for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955). However, he was not Cecil B. DeMille's first choice to score the film.

He was so excited that he refused to wash off the makeup, when he went home, that night, so he would not have to put it back on the next day.","Cecil B. DeMille originally filmed The Ten Commandments (1923), as a silent-film. Because it was all that was available, at that time.","Considerable controversy exists over who supplied the voice of God for the film, for which no on-screen credit is given. The voice used was heavily modified and mixed with other sound effects, making identification extremely difficult. Various people have either claimed or been rumored to have supplied the voice: Cecil B. DeMille himself (he narrated the film), Charlton Heston and Delos Jewkes, to name a few. DeMille's publicist and biographer Donald Hayne maintains that Heston provided the voice of God at the burning bush, but he himself provided the voice of God giving the commandments. In the 2004 DVD release, Heston in an interview admitted that he was the voice of God.","Cecil B. DeMille's original choice for Moses was William Boyd, best known as \"Hopalong Cassidy\". Boyd turned down the role, fearing his \"Hopalong Cassidy\" popularity, would hurt the movie's fame, deeply.","Charlton Heston was chosen for the role of Moses by Cecil B. DeMille because he bore a resemblance to Michelangelo's statue of Moses in Rome. Heston later played Michelangelo in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965).","When Woody Strode reported to work, he presented Cecil B. DeMille with an antique Bible, that Woody Strode's wife had found. DeMille was so impressed with the gift he not only put Strode in two parts in the film but told Strode that if he ever wanted a part in a future DeMille film, all he had to do was ask. Unfortunately, this project was DeMille's final film, due to declining health.","This was Cecil B. DeMille's only movie made in widescreen. Four years had elapsed between DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952) and \"The Ten commandments\", by which time widescreen films had become standard practice. In 1952, when \"Greatest Show\" was released, all films, except for \"This is Cinerama\", were still being made in the old non-widescreen Academy ratio.","In adjusted-for-inflation gross, this movie is the top grossing movie in the US that has not benefited from multiple releases.

Red dye was pumped into the water through a hose at the point where Aaron touched the river, with his staff. Sapp also created the vessel that was used by Rameses' priest in an attempt to restore the waters. The vessel had two chambers: one that was filled with clear water and which was located near the vessel's opening, while the other chamber was filled with red-dyed water was located near the bottom of the vessel. As the vessel was tipped to empty its contents, the clear water poured out first, and as the vessel was tipped further, this released the red-dyed water into the \"river\" on the sound stage. There were six of these vessels that were made for the film, but only two were used during production. The reverse shot showing the red water extending out into the sea was created through animation onto shots of the Red Sea that had been photographed in Egypt.","Another plague was filmed but was not used. According to the commentary on the 50th Anniversary DVD, in 2006. This was the plague of frogs leaving the muddied Nile, coming up onto land, frightening and chasing Nefretiri and other Egyptians through their chambers of the palace. Cecil B. DeMille felt that the scene was not frightening enough, and could even be considered it too humorous, thus, he omitted it from its final filming and completion, just before he and all other directors and production staff completed it and it would start being seen, in theaters, in 1956.","Animation was employed to create the hail as it was falling from the sky in the background, but popcorn that had been spray-painted white fell as \"hail\" onto the pavilion of Rameses' palace. It was light so it could not hurt the actors, it bounced like real hail; and it could be swept up and used again for additional takes of the scene. The fire that burned from the hail was created by animation.","The illusion of the Red Sea parting was achieved by large \"dump tanks\" that were flooded, then the film was shown in reverse. The two frothing walls of water were created by water dumped constantly into \"catch basin areas\" then the foaming, churning water was visually manipulated and used sideways for the walls of water. A gelatin substance was added to the water in the tanks to give it more of a sea water consistency. Although the dump tanks have long since been removed, the catch basin section of this tank still exists today on the Paramount lot, directly in front of the exterior sky backdrop, in the central portion of the studio. It can still be flooded for water scenes, but when not being used in a production, it is an extension of a parking lot.","Atleast 14,000 extras and 15,000 animals were used, during the production and acting, as the movie was being filmed.","Urban legend has it that Anne Baxter's character's name was changed from Nefertiti to Nefertiri because Cecil B. DeMille was afraid people would make \"boob\" jokes. In reality, DeMille was sticking to history: Rameses II's queen was called Nefretiri. Nefertiti lived about 60 years earlier than Rameses and Nefertiti. Both names mean \"Beautiful\".","2 CAMEOS (and in same scene): Babette Bain was Little Miriam, whileFraser Clarke Heston, son of Charlton Heston was Moses, as an infant.","There is a longstanding rumor that future Cuban dictator Fidel Castro was an extra in this film, possibly playing an Egyptian soldier. In her book \"My Lucky Stars\", Shirley MacLaine recalls asking Castro if he indeed was in the film, and she received an ambiguous answer, from her question.","The special effects work was so extensive that it was not completed by the final edit. The released version contains fringing during some blue screen shots which the crew did not have time to correct.","When asking the Egyptian authorities for permission to film there, Cecil B. DeMille was pleasantly surprised to find out they were fans of his film The Crusades (1935). \"You treated us [Arabs in the film] so well, you may do anything here you want,\" they told him.","Produced at a then-staggering cost of $13 million, the film went on to become Paramount's biggest-grossing movie to that time.

Jensen and Arnold Friberg did not work primarily in designing any costumes. Jensen was the lead sketch artist, and only worked in sketching out designs for certain costumes. Friberg was primarily hired to design the film's titles, which were hand lettered and photographed over a colored leather background. Friberg also contributed sketches regarding the costuming. The costume for Moses as a shepherd was patterned after one Friberg had already painted, a portrayal of an ancient prophet for \"The Childrens Friend\", a magazine published by the Primary Association, the children's organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which Friberg is a member.","According to Hollywood lore, while filming the orgy sequence which precedes Moses' descent from Mount Horeb with the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments engraved, Cecil B. DeMille was perched on top of a ladder delivering his customarily long-winded directions through a megaphone to the hundreds of extras involved in the scene. After droning on to the extras for several minutes, DeMille was distracted by one young woman who was persistently talking to the woman standing next to her. DeMille stopped his speech and addressed everyone's attention to the young woman. \"Here,\" DeMille said, \"We have a young woman whose conversation with her friend is apparently more important than listening to her instructions from her director while we are all engaged in making motion picture history. Perhaps the young woman would care to enlighten us all, and tell us what the devil is so important that it cannot wait until after we make this shot.\" After a moment, of silence and temporary fright, she spoke up and boldly confessed, \"I was just saying to my friend,'I wonder when that bald-headed old fart is gonna call'Lunch!'\" DeMille stared at her for a moment, paused, then lifted his megaphone, and then shouted, \"Lunch!\"","Audrey Hepburn was originally slated for the role of \"Nefretiri\". Cecil B. DeMille reluctantly decided to pass on her after it was judged that she was too \"slender\" (i.e., flat-chested). Anne Baxter, who was eventually cast in the role, had originally been a contender for the role of \"Sephora.\"","Pre-production work on this film included over 1,200 storyboard sketches.","The script contained 308 pages with 70 speaking parts.","Producer/Director Cecil B. DeMille reached 75 years of age during the production of this film, making him the oldest working Hollywood director. He later suffered a heart-attack on the set, returning to the set only two days later. After this was completed, he planned on another epic production. He died in 1959, before he could direct or produce another, making this his final film.","Because of the numerous scenes that required multiple cameras to be running simultaneously, Paramount had the Mitchell Camera Corporation build additional VistaVision cameras for this production. Decades later, these cameras were highly sought after by special effects companies due to their ability to produce large area negatives on standard 35mm filmstock.","Originally, when Elmer Bernstein was orchestrating the music to accompany the Great Exodus of the slaves out of Egypt, the music was mournful. Upon hearing it, Cecil B. DeMille ordered him to replace it, substituting joyful, upbeat music to announce the Hebrew slaves' joy, getting their freedom.","According to Charlton Heston's autobiography, the filming of the orgy scenes was so grueling, it prompted one female extra to exclaim, \"Who do I have to f**k to get OUT of this movie?\"","This is perhaps the only Paramount film in which the VistaVision \"Motion Picture High Fidelity\" logo, together with its accompanying musical fanfare, does not appear at all.","[June 2008] Ranked #10 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre \"Epic\".","During the early part of principal photography, Yul Brynner was still on Broadway starring in The King and I (1956). All of his shots on the actual Egyptian locations were done in one day after which he had to fly back to New York.","Several shots that appear throughout the movie are shots that were matted together from scenes shots on location in Egypt and scenes shots at the Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Most notable scenes featuring this multi-location matte-shooting are the scenes which Moses and Sethi watch the Obelisk being raised; the slaves in the background were shot in Egypt, the foreground with Moses and Sethi shot in Hollywood, and the background pylons being matte paintings.","The red smoke on top of Mt. Sinai, which symbolized God's presence on the mountain, was a matted special effect superimposed over a shot of the actual Mt. Sinai filmed on location.","The cloud special effects used during the parting of the Red Sea scenes, would later be repeatedly used in various movies by director Steven Spielberg.","Martha Scott, who played Charlton Heston's mother, in his two Biblical epics, The Ten Commandments (1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), was only ten years older than her on-screen son.","When Yul Brynner was told he would be playing Pharaoh Rameses II, opposite of Charlton Heston's Moses and that he would be shirtless for a majority of the film, he began a rigorous weight lifting program because he did not want to be physically overshadowed by Charlton Heston (which explains his buffer than normal physique during The King and I (1956), his other film he was acted and on, approximately a month apart, at the time of the two films, as they were started and completed.","Gloria Swanson was originally cast as Memnet, but she was then having difficulties getting a backer for a musical stage version of Sunset Blvd. (1950) so she had to depart from the project (The musical eventually had to be abandoned in the early 1960s, even after a cast album was recorded during out-of-town tryouts).","Charlton Heston personally requested to Cecil B. DeMille to let him be the voice of God, at the scene of the Burning Bush, and DeMille agreed.","Final feature film of Luis Alberni and Paul Harvey.","Although by 1956 virtually all widescreen epics were being filmed with stereophonic sound, The Ten Commandments (1956) was not filmed in stereo. The sound was remixed to stereo for later releases.","Because the only widescreen process that Paramount used at the time was VistaVision, the screen used for the original release of The Ten Commandments (1956) was not as wide as those used for processes such as Cinemascope and Todd-AO, although the movie was a 1956 Technicolor epic.","In the initial Egyptian sequence, Nefretiri is referred to as \"the throne princess\" who \"must marry the next Pharaoh.\" According to ancient Egyptian royal custom, this implies that she is Seti's daughter, who is expected to marry his successor, regardless of her kinship to that man. (The real Nefretiri's parentage is unknown.) But if Seti was explicitly identified as her father, it would be clear that in the end, Ramses married his sister in an incestuous union. This was evidently seen as inappropriate for a 1950s audience that would certainly include children. As a result, Nefretari was only called \"the throne princess,\" without any explanation, this is why she has enjoyed that distinction, while it was in progress.","According to author Simon Louvish in his Cecil B. DeMille biography Cecil B. DeMille: A Life in Art, the role of Moses was originally intended for (and first offered to) actor William Boyd, who had also played the coveted cameo role of Simon the Cyrene in DeMille's silent film The King of Kings (1927). Boyd was obliged to decline the role in \"The Ten Commandments\" due to his commitment to the production of his enormously popular &#x22;Hopalong Cassidy&#x22; (1952) television series, which was scheduled to continue production simultaneous to the filming of the DeMille picture. DeMille was persuaded to hire actor Charlton Heston for the role after being presented with a statuette likeness of Moses by the Israeli government, and noting the Heston's resemblance to the statuette.","The pillar of fire, which kept the Egyptians from getting closer to the Israelites just before they crossed the Red Sea, was not achieved through the use of actual flames, but was instead, an animated \"cartoon fire\". Of all the special effects in the film, it is the one that looks the least realistic to modern audiences, and probably seemed just as unrealistic in 1956.","SPOILER: In the scene in which Rameses carried the dead body of his son, (Eugene Mazzola), onto the arms of the statue of Sokar, the body changed from Eugene Mazzola's actual body to a wax dummy. The statue was unable to support Mazzola's actual body weight, it was also difficult for Mazzola to be stay, motionless, in one place, and stay still, as if he were dead, after he was placed on the statue and remain there, motionless, full-time.","SPOILER: At the end of the movie, after Charlton Heston as Moses has turned over leadership of the Israelites to Joshua, he watches as the Israelites march into Caanan. At this point, Moses was supposed to have been enveloped in the fog coming down from the mountain, but the effect was never completed. As a result, Moses is shown to be standing there watching the Israelites go, and this is closer to what is related in the actual Bible than what Cecil B. DeMille originally intended.","SPOILER: At the concluding scene, when when Moses was saying goodbye, he gave Eliazar the 5 books (Torah) he had written under the direction of God. What Moses was holding in his hand was a worn but modern day portfolio. Charlton Heston said he tried to get Cecil B. DeMille to make them scrolls, which would be more suitable for them, but Cecil B. DeMille refused."],"tt0009968":["While filming the closet scene, Lillian Gish's performance of pure terror was so realistic that D.W. Griffith was compelled to shout back at her and urge her further. A passerby heard this going on and, convinced that something terrible was going on, had to be restrained from entering the studio.","This film was selected to the National Film Registry, Library of Congress, in 1996.","This movie was originally made for Adolph Zukor at Paramount Pictures. D.W. Griffith bought it from him in order to release it through his new company, United Artists.","Lillian Gish did not want to make the picture and D.W. Griffith had to work hard to persuade her to do it. She later said she was glad she consented.","Filming took 18 days and nights. Donald Crisp's scenes were filmed at night because he was directing another film during the day.","D.W. Griffith saw Lillian Gish using her smile gesture with her fingers and decided to incorporate it into the filming.","The only makeup Richard Barthelmess used in order to appear Oriental was a very tight rubber band stretched around his forehead, pulling his facial features slightly upward. The rubber band was cleverly concealed beneath his cap.","Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl (1919) was produced by D.W. Griffith for Adolph Zukor's Artcraft company, a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. But when Griffith delivered the final print of the film to Zukor, the producer was outraged. \"How dare you deliver such a terrible film to me!\" Zukor raged. \"Everybody in the picture dies!\" Infuriated, Griffith left Zukor's office and returned the next day with $250,000 in cash, which he threw on Zukor's desk. \"Here,\" Griffith shouted, \"If you don't want the picture, I'll buy it back from you.\" Zukor accepted the offer, and Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl (1919) thus became the first film released by United Artists, the production company formed in 1919 by Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith. Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl (1919) was a remarkably successful film, both critically and at the box office.","The film's premiere engagement included a live prologue featuring a dance routine performed by actress' Carol Dempster'. During Dempster's dance the stage was illuminated by blue and gold footlights. Later, during the screening of the film, a stagehand accidentally switched on the blue and gold footlights used during Dempster's dance, and the lights cast upon the movie screen tinted the film in an unusual way. D.W. Griffith, standing in the rear of the auditorium, was so surprised and delighted at the blue and gold-tinted effect of the footlights on his movie that he ordered all copies of Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl (1919) tinted in those colors during certain key sequences."],"tt0015324":["In one scene at a train station, Buster Keaton was hanging off of a tube connected to a water basin. The water poured out and washed him on to the track, fracturing his neck nearly to the point of breaking it. This footage appears in the released film. Keaton suffered from blinding migraines for years after making this movie and was unaware of the reason, until a doctor diagnosed him in the 1930s.","This film was selected to the National Film Registry, Library of Congress, in 1991.","Buster Keaton doubled for Ford West, the actor playing Gillette, in the scene where the motorcycle he is driving (with Keaton on the handlebars) hits a deep pothole and bucks him off flat on his behind.","Some filmographies credit Roscoe &#x27;Fatty&#x27; Arbuckle as co-director of this film. The confusion comes from the fact that Buster Keaton did originally hope to have Arbuckle work as his co-director, but Arbuckle was still too depressed over the scandal that had nearly ended his career three years earlier and had become difficult to work with, so Keaton went ahead as the sole director of the film. The claim that Arbuckle was a co-director on the film was made by Minta Durfee ; however, her claim lost credibility because she also stated that Arbuckle was the sole screenwriter of the film. The script was definitely written by Joseph A. Mitchell, Jean C. Havez and Clyde Bruckman - Keaton's usual team of gagmen from this time. Historians agree there is no credibility to the claim that Arbuckle ever directed so much as a frame of the movie.","A title card in \"Hearts and Pearls\", the film within the film during which Buster Keaton falls asleep, informs us that it was produced by the \"Veronal Film Company\" - an appropriate name, since Veronal was the first barbiturate sleeping pill ever marketed.","For the scene where Sherlock Jr., escaping some gangsters, leaps headfirst through the body of his assistant, Gillette (who is disguised as an old lady selling neckties), and disappears, Buster Keaton used an old magician's trick. Prior to the trick, Gillette is seen standing with his back against a wooden fence. A section of the fence was sawed out and placed on hinges, so that it opened up and back like a garage door. Ford West (the actor playing Gillette) was then strapped to the underside of the cutaway section, so that when it was opened, West's body was hanging parallel to the ground, but his head and arms stuck out through the upper part of the opening in the fence. The dress and open suitcase were then hung from West's shoulders, so that they hung down in front of the fence, concealing the opening. Both the dress and the suitcase had holes cut in them. With the cameras rolling, Keaton leaped headfirst straight through the hole in the suitcase, the hole in the dress, and the opening in the fence. (He later recalled that he \"landed face-first in the dirt\" on the other side.) The cutaway fence section was then swung down to close the opening, so that West's body landed perfectly inside the dress. Attendants on the other side of the fence cut the straps holding West's torso and feet to the cutaway section, and West stepped away from the fence as if nothing had happened. In the film, you can see West reach behind his back to close the opening in the dress as he steps from the fence. If you look closely, you can also see the outline of the cutaway section in the fence.","For the sequence in which Buster Keaton's \"dream-self\" enters the \"movie within a movie,\" Keaton employed the power of suggestion. He shot an actual movie featuring Ward Crane and Kathryn McGuire in a living room setting. As the sequence begins, the movie is playing on the theater movie screen. The film cuts back and forth between Buster sleeping in the projection booth, and his \"dream-self\" climbing on stage as the movie is showing. In the scene where Buster's \"dream-self\" steps through the movie screen and into the movie, the living room setting was re-created on the theater stage, and a large hole was cut in the movie screen for Keaton to step through. The actors were placed in the living room setting, creating the illusion that Buster stepped inside the movie screen to join them.","Following his \"entrance\" into the \"movie within a movie,\" the scenery changes around Buster Keaton very quickly, as if the movie is changing scenes with quick edits. (He suddenly finds himself on a crowded city street, in the jungle confronted by lions, on a rock in the middle of the ocean, etc.) Keaton later recalled that his cameraman, Byron Houck, had used surveying instruments to position him and the camera at the exact correct distances and positions to give the illusion of continuity as the scenes changed.","Sherlock Jr.'s assistant, Gillette, is named after William Gillette, the first actor to play Sherlock Holmes on stage.","A a 14\" x 36\" poster for Rex Ingram's Scaramouche (1923) is prominently displayed outside the theatre.","In 1965, a year before Buster Keaton died, author Rudi Blesh interviewed him for a biography and asked, \"How did you come to make a surrealistic film like'Sherlock, Jr.'?\" Keaton replied, \"I did NOT mean it to be surrealistic. I just wanted it to look like a dream.\"","According to the book Buster is reading, the seven rules for being a detective are: 1. Search Everybody. 2. Look for Clue. 3. Examine all windows. 4. Search for finger prints. 5. Shadow your man closely. 6. Send for the police. 7. Keep cool.

He repeats this several times until Abbott stops him and asks why he's so thirsty. Besser replies that he's not thirsty, it's that his tent is on fire. That was based on an incident in Costello's childhood, when he accidentally set some clothes in his bedroom on fire. His father was in the living room, which was between the kitchen and Costello's bedroom. Costello, not wanting to let his father know that he had set his room on fire, dashed back and forth between the kitchen and his bedroom with glasses of water until his father finally asked what was going on, whereupon Costello was forced to tell what he had done.","Features the only on-screen pairing of Joe Besser and Shemp Howard, who were respectively considered the 4th and 5th members of the Three Stooges.","The comment by Boots (Buddy Baer) to Grappler (Max Baer), \"I'll hit you harder than Louis ever did\", is a reference to Max Baer's career as a heavyweight boxer.

Joe.","Rachel Nichols was the first choice for the role of Scarlett O'Hara.","Stephen Sommers felt that this was the closest he would get to making a James Bond film. It pays homage to several 007 films.","Stephen Sommers took great care over the technology depicted in the film, going through various books/magazines about weapons technology. He feels that almost 100% of the technology can be developed within 10-20 years.","According to Stephen Sommers, total invisibility is impossible, but the camouflage cameras in the film (they project the view from a soldier's back onto their front) can allow for virtual invisibility.","The Delta-6 accelerator suits delighted Stuart Beattie and made him write up \"a car chase where one guy's not even in a car!\" However, they were bulky and heavy for the actors to wear and for any planned sequels their use will be reduced.","Ray Park had little knowledge of the G.I. Joe saga, but as a child he had played with a Snake-Eyes action figure. He was thus delighted to play a childhood hero of his, but had to read the G.I. Joe comics to understand his character better.","Ray Park enjoyed his role of Snake-Eyes and approached writer Kevin VanHook and artist S. L. Gallant with the idea of a G.I. Joe comic further exploring his incarnation of the character.","Ray Park was nervous about wearing the ninja suit and asked to practice with it at home so that he could be comfortable with it.

Joe saga, but was advised by the filmmakers not to learn about his character, letting his portrayal stand by itself. He describes Storm Shadow as defined and driven by two conflicting facets: \"huge pride and a sense of honour.\"","A post-credits scene was planned, in which famously mute ninja Snake-Eyes tells a joke to the G.I.

Though his scenes were allegedly filmed and his name was included in early promotional materials (and on the film's official website) he's nowhere to be seen in the final theatrical cut.","Subliminal frames from the Ring video are inserted in the film. For example, the'Ring' image can be glimpsed for a fraction of a second in the transition between the ferry/horse sequence and Rachel's car drive to Anna Morgan's farm on Moesko Island.","The other videos on the shelf where Rachel finds the Ring video are: Shattered (1991), Scent of a Woman (1992), Spontaneous Combustion (1990), Yor, the Hunter from the Future (1983), The Last Days of Sodom and Gomorrah (1962), The Looking Glass War (1969), Visions of a New World (1995), Family Plot (1976), Steel Magnolias (1989), The Man from Snowy River (1982) and School Ties (1992).","The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for Ring (1998)) but his name is absent from the final print.","There are several visual references to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, including Rear Window (1954), Psycho (1960) and Family Plot (1976). Ironically, Hitchcock himself once directed a totally unrelated boxing movie called The Ring (1927/I).","Subtle images of circles in various forms, such as the designs on the doctor's sweater, the shower drain and Rachel's apartment number, appear throughout the movie.","The red Japanese maple (seen in the video) was artificial, built out of steel tubing and plaster, with painted silk for the leaves. (The crew dubbed it \"Lucille\" after \"a certain red-haired actress\"). While filming in Washington state, the tree was erected three times, only to have it knocked over by nearly 100-mile-an-hour wind gusts. In Los Angeles it was erected for a fourth time, only to be blown down again, this time by 60-mile-an-hour winds.","The tree with the fiery red leaves featured in the movie is a Japanese maple. The fruit of this tree is known as a \"samara\".","In both the American and Japanese versions, the name of the little girl is connected to a story about death.

In an earlier cut of the film, the cabin manager dies from watching the tape (see \"Alternate Versions\"). Probably that's the reason for the inn being closed.","Numerous scenes were cut down or entirely cut from the film before release. Some scenes were present only at test screenings. Others showed up in previews or the \"Don't Watch This\" short film on the DVD.- Samara's line \"Everyone will suffer\" was cut out the film but can be heard in the previews.- The bathtub suicide was much more graphic.- Samara's murder lasted longer in the original cut of the film and was much more brutal than what audiences saw in theatres. Originally, the plastic bag over Samara's head failed to subdue her, leading her killer to repeatedly strike her in the head with a large rock (which can be seen lying on the ground in some shots of the well). The rock only weakened Samara, and finally her killer resorted to slamming her head against the side of the well before dumping her in.- Some test screenings contained scenes at the beginning and end of the film involving a murderer played by Chris Cooper. The first scene involved the murderer approaching Rachel, asking her to help clear his name, claiming he is rehabilitated and no longer a threat to society. She knows he's lying and refuses. Then at the end of the movie, she pays him a visit and drops off a copy of the video. Noah goes over to Rachel's apartment and trying to find the video. When the babysitter hears him say it's a homemade video and it might be in the bedroom, she starts laughing. He finds the distorted pictures of the kids from the beginning in Rachel's room. One of the pictures shows the sign for the inn. This leads into another scene where Noah goes to the rental cabins and finds the body of the cabin manager dead in a canoe on the lake.- There was a scene where asks crab-fishers on the island about the Morgans. They say that no one could get a good haul when Samara was around. There's additional material with Rachel in Cabin 12 where she tries to watch TV, but the reception is terrible and finds a journal left by the previous guests.- Visual effects supervisor Charles Gibson said in an interview that another sequence was \"previsualized\", but cut from the film. \"It was an all-CG montage of the'Ring' tape being created from a point of view inside the VCR.- There is an alternate scene for Rachel and Ruth's discussion at the funeral, Rachel searches Katie's room and finds the ticket for photos. Ruth comes in and they discuss information Rachel found out from some of Katie's friends. Ruth becomes frustrated and angry about not knowing why Katie died, and charges towards the closet and explains to Rachel that she found Katie there. There is a flashback with Ruth finding Katie's corpse in the closet (same flashback used in the funeral scene).- Midway through the movie Rachel rents some movies and gets laughs from one of the employees over her picks. This led to an alternate ending, in which Rachel put the cursed tape in the sleeve for one of her rented movies and returned it to the store, where it ended up under \"employee picks.\"","An interesting feature on the VHS release: rewind the tape to the very beginning. (Or just put the tape in the VCR when fully rewound.) When you play it, you see the cursed video. After the segment ends, you hear a phone ringing twice, then it goes into the previews. Also after the movie has ended, you see additional scenes that help explain the mystery of the cursed video.","Scott Frank revised the screenplay.","This film was originally promoted under the title \"Ring,\" like \"Ringu\", the original Japanese film upon which it is based.

The website contained links that led to other movie-related mock-ups, including a page written by one of Katie's friends who was unaware of Katie's death and believed she'd been kidnapped or run away, and a page written by scientists who researched psychic phenomena involving television transmissions.

Dmytryk also stated that he was unaware of studio head Harry Cohn's strict insistence that Columbia films run no longer than 2 hours and indicated that Roberts quit over the stipulated cuts required to bring the screenplay down to fit the time requirement. The final screenplay was trimmed by nearly fifty pages by writer Michael Blankfort, who is credited on screen with \"additional dialog.\"","To capture the excitement of the typhoon scene, the filmmakers originally intended to steer the ship (a replica of the USS Caine) into an actual gale for the bad-weather footage. It was eventually decided that the typhoon would be artificially created in a studio by special effects technician Lawrence W. Butler.","Columbia Studios was determined to hire Humphrey Bogart for the top role in The Caine Mutiny (1954), and Bogart was enthusiastic about playing Captain Queeg, but the Columbia brass did not want to pay him his top salary. Bogart was rather miffed at this, complaining to wife Lauren Bacall, \"This never happens to Gary Cooper, or Cary Grant or Clark Gable, but always to me.\" Bogart correctly figured that Harry Cohn and company knew that Bogart wanted to play the part so fervently that he would agree to take less money rather than surrender the part to someone else.","Humphrey Bogart's tour de force performance in the climactic courtroom scene was so powerful that it completely captivated the onlooking film technicians and crewmen.

In \"Stanley Kramer: Filmmaker\" by Donald Spoto, Dmytryk said, \"..it's a disappointment in my career, to tell the truth. I insist it could have been a classic...but Kramer, who (with Dore Schary) is the most publicity-conscious man in the industry, got high-handed with Harry Cohn, and in fact had to toe the line...Stanley Roberts' original script was about 190 pages, even without the romantic subplot...It should have remained that - a three and one-half or four-hour picture - and it would have been more logically developed, the characters would have been further fleshed out. It would have been perfect.\"","Preparations for filming took 15 months. The length of time it took to make the film, unusually long at the time, was due in part to the unwillingness of the US Navy to endorse the film. Without the Navy's endorsement, it would have been impossible for the filmmakers to use naval equipment and personnel. The Navy was concerned that the film's subject dealt with a mutiny, and that audience would feel that it was a true story. But the filmmakers reached a compromise upon agreeing to include the comment in the opening titles that there has never been a mutiny on a US Navy vessel.","The following is engraved on a plaque in the officers' wardroom.

Such was the effectiveness of the film that Dmytryk even received a DGA nomination.","Additional (and uncredited) dialog was provided by blacklisted writer Michael Blankfort.","Most of the Hollywood studios wouldn't touch Herman Wouk's best-seller because they knew that the only way they could make the film would be with the full cooperation of the Department of Defense, which would insist on making sweeping changes to the film (the DOD was openly critical of Wouk's depiction of the Navy). Undeterred, independent producer Stanley Kramer optioned the novel for $60,000. Once the novel won the Pulitzer Prize, the DOD had to soften its attitude towards the novel, given its huge popularity.

Then a great bonfire of red fir bark would be pushed evenly over the edge of the cliff, appearing to the onlookers below as a glowing waterfall of sparks and fire. In 1968 the Park Service Director decided that the Firefall tradition should come to an end. He reasoned that since it was just a man-made attraction, and one which caused a great deal of congestion in the park, as well as damage to the meadows from the trampling of onlookers, that it wasn't worth continuing. He went as far as to point out that it caused the unnatural and unnecessary removal of red-fir bark from the park grounds.","The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial opened at the Plymouth Theater on January 20, 1954 and ran for 415 performances starring Henry Fonda and Lloyd Nolan.","The scars seen on Van Johnson's face in this film are real, not makeup.

In addition, Bogart was already seriously ill with espohagal cancer, although it would not be diagnosed until January 1956.","In the novel the Caine is a WWI vintage \"flush deck\" destroyer with 4 smokestacks.

For example, the backflip off of the motorcycle was done with a trampoline.","The film's fight choreographer Jim Vickers and Kurt Wimmer had some slight disagreement on how the martial art Gun Kata should be performed on screen. You can see little friendly jabs to the choreographer in the film. When Kurt Wimmer performs the Gun Kata at the beginning, you see it's very fluid and smooth. The way it's actually used in the film is very rigid with a few flowing moves thrown in. Also, in Angus Macfadyen's speech to the Clerics in training, he says \"each fluid position\", slightly stressing the word \"fluid\". Wimmer wanted Gun Kata to be smooth and soft-style. Vickers, trained in hard-style karate among other things, modified the original Gun Kata slightly, and because of budgetary restraints, that's the version we see in the final film. Wimmer has said his own vision of Gun Kata can be seen in most of its glory in his next film, Ultraviolet (2006).","The white sword and ribbon used just before \"without incident\" sequence was not attached. The intention was that it would be sewn on and that Bale would rip it off at the appropriate moment, but they couldn't get the stitching to work so that it would rip just right. Finally, they decided to leave it unsown, and just have Bale hold it with his hand for the few seconds he was on camera.","Tetragrammaton (translation: \"word with four letters\"), is actually a word used in Judaism in reference to the name of God. \"YHWH\".","Some of the tank-like vehicles seen driving along the streets are, in fact, white-painted airport tugs, the kinds used for pushing very large aircraft such as 747s.","Director Cameo: [Kurt Wimmer ]  1.

This was done as a sign of respect to the native people of West Auckland, whose lands were used for filming locations.","When placing ads in \"The New Zealand Herald\" for extras, the first call was put out for people under five feet and over six feet four. Calls for extras were made in New Zealand's main cities of Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch over a period of two weeks. Later calls were for moderately tall males and females.","The makers asked for permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the Ice Queen's sled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry denied, citing the potentially deadly Q Fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves were allowed in for filming in Auckland.","Tilda Swinton, first choice for the role of Jadis the White Witch, hadn't read the book prior to filming. She wore platform shoes under costume to make her taller, and used a brace on her shoulders between takes to give her a break from the weight of her wig and crown.","Cameo: [Jaxin Hall ]  When the Pevensies are at the train station, Peter William Moseley looks at a soldier, played by Jaxin Hall, the runner-up for the part of Peter.","Georgie Henley's reaction to Mr. Tumnus at the lamppost is genuine. She had not seen her cast mate James McAvoy in his costume before the scene was filmed, so her screams and reaction were real. Georgie's first reaction to the snowy world of Narnia is also genuine - she was carried into the set blindfolded to make her first entrance, and her wide-eyed, delighted reactions to it all are entirely her own.","The motive power for the Pevensies' evacuation train was GWR 7802 Bradley Manor, one of the former Great Western Railway's Manor-class steam locomotives. Nine out of the thirty Manor-class locomotives built survive today.","The movie was mostly shot in chronological order. The final scene where the Pevensie's fall out of the wardrobe was shot before all the outdoor shots so the kids would still be pale and look like they had in the beginning of the film.","The historical artifact that Mrs. MacReady warns Susan not to touch is the bust of Dante Alighieri.","Brian Cox was originally set to voice Aslan.","When the adults' swearing got out of hand on the set, Georgie Henley (Lucy) set up a swear bucket. James McAvoy was supposedly the worst offender. Even her teenager co-stars had to pay their toll, though, especially Skandar Keynes, accordingly to DVD's commentary.","EASTER EGG: On disc 2, on the menu for Evolution of an Epic, there's a director's chair on the left-hand side of the menu. Pointing your remote on it will cause a little red symbol to appear. Click on the symbol, and it takes you to a short featurette showing how much Turkish delight Skandar Keynes had to eat.","Several birds had made nests within the filming studio, and several scenes had to be filmed twice due to the noise these birds were making. A green screen was used to film one of these birds who leads the children from Tumnus's house to the Beavers.","The wolves that destroyed the Beavers' home were mostly real animals with one or two CGI ones added in, although their tails had to be digitally removed and re-added. Their tails kept wagging while filming the scene, making them seem less vicious.","The CGI on Mr. Tumnus was from his waist down - his goat legs and hooves. His ears were controlled by remote control and a fake nose along with a lot of hair was attached.","When Lucy meets Mr. Tumnus the faun, he plays music for her on a funny-looking Narnian instrument. The actual sound heard is produced by the duduk (doudouk, düdük), an ancient wind instrument, famously featured in Sergei Parajanov's Color of Pomegranates (1968) as well as Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992); the use of the duduk has become almost a tradition in Hollywood blockbusters. The instrument that Mr. Tumnus uses on set is actually a figment of the prop department's imagination. In the book Tumnus plays, as a faun, a Pan's flute. It's an instrument which is very difficult to play or even to mime playing.","According to the \"Narnia\" books, Professor Kirke (played by Jim Broadbent) is the elderly Digory Kirke. As a boy, Digory Kirke was the hero of The Magician's Nephew, the Narnia book that takes place chronologically before the events in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. (This explains the Professor's willingness to believe that the Pevensie children have ventured to a magic land.) The Magician's Nephew tells the story of the creation of Narnia, the coming of Jadis, the White Witch, the creation of the lamp post, and the creation of the wardrobe itself. Each design carved into the wardrobe signifies an important event that occurs in The Magician's Nephew.","Anna Popplewell is afraid of mice, so her scenes involving mice had to be shot with her double.","The German planes seen at the beginning of the film were HE-111 Bombers.","The role of Edmund was cast last of the four children. That helped making his character a bit detached to his siblings, since the other three actors had been together in a workshop for almost a month by the time Skandar got the part. Skandar absolutely hated being hugged by the other kids, so to ramp up on-screen antagonism, the director used every opportunity to have them do just that - even if the scene was finished! Skandar was absent during the scene where Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, Anna Popplewell wore his costume from the waist down and did the scene for him. After his voice changed during filming, some of his voice track had to be re-looped by his sister.","In the Audio Commentary, Skandar Keynes comments that William Moseley coerced him into eating some of the sugar glass from the broken picture of their father in the beginning of the movie. Only after trying did Skander realize the fake glass was made of silicon.","Professor Kirke presents three choices to the other Pevensie children of what to think about Lucy's claim about Narnia: that she is lying, that she is mad, or that she is telling the truth. C.S. Lewis was a vocal advocate of Christianity, and in his book \"Mere Christianity\" presented three similar choices about Jesus' claim to be the Son of God: Liar, Lunatic, or Lord. This is known as his \"Trilemma\" argument, and is still often used by Christians today.","Before his death, C.S. Lewis sold the adaptation rights to the entire \"Narnia\" series. At that time, he absolutely despised television adaptations of his books, believing they were non-realistic, since actors had to wear suits to play non-human characters. It was only after seeing a demo reel of creatures created with computer graphics and the advancement of that technology that Lewis's stepson/co-producer Douglas Gresham gave the approval for a film adaptation.","No real lions were used for the film, simply because Andrew Adamson wanted a moment where Georgie Henley could reach out and touch Aslan. It took approximately 10 hours to render each frame of the CGI Aslan and his 5.2 million individual hairs.","During filming, William Moseley (Peter) kept accidentally hitting Georgie Henley (Lucy) with his sword handle and making her trip when he ran too quickly.","In scenes where the children had to react or talk to CG characters, Andrew Adamson, the director, and Alina Phelan, his assistant, would provide the voices for those non-existing characters, to make it easier for the kids to respond to someone who really isn't there.","There are three versions of Peter's sword: steel, aluminum, and rubber. William Moseley preferred working with the aluminum swords for the fighting scenes because they were a lot lighter and \"they didn't bounce like the rubber swords.\"","Aslan is a Turkish word meaning Lion. Lewis came up with the name during a trip to Turkey before 1922, where he saw the Sultan's elite guards, called Aslan because of their bravery and loyalty. The name of the White Witch is \"Jadis,\" a French word meaning \"of old.\" Aslan explains that the witch practices the very old \"deep magic,\" but his \"magic\" is even older--from \"before the dawn of time.\" \"Jadis\" is the usual start to French fairy tales (much like the English phrase \"Once upon a time...\").","The inscription on the blade of Peter's sword reads, \"When Aslan shakes his mane, Narnia shall know spring again.\"","When Peter is talking to Aslan, Aslan says \"Beaver also mentioned something about you turning him into a hat\". That line was not originally in the movie. The smile you see is William Moseley smiling because a fly was buzzing around his head, which rendered the shot useless.","John August was originally asked to do the screenplay, but had to decline due other projects.","The Witch's coachman is unnamed in the book. The filmmakers named him Ginaarbrik, deciding that he is an ancestor of Nikabrik from The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008). The two dwarrow wear the same family ring in the films.","The four kids made up a dance which they sang to whenever Andrew Adamson said \"check the gate\" after each take. \"Check the gate\" means check that there are no hairs or other foreign bodies between the film and the gate which holds the film in a flat plane within the camera; such hairs would show up on the film and make the shot useless.","While filming the snowball fight scene, the four kids had a snowball fight with director Andrew Adamson between takes.","Due to the way the rating systems work in the Netherlands and Germany, the original version of the film was rated for kids aged 12 and above. However, the distributor wanted the film to be more accessible to a family audience. Subsequently, in a highly unusual move, the film was reedited for the Dutch and German markets, and the new cut received a rating for ages 6 and up. Edits included diminished sound effects, battle scenes, animal attack scenes, and war images.","The Dutch audience awarded it with the'TV Krant Filmposter Award' of 2005.","During the air-raid sequence, the photo of the Pevensie's father which Edmund risks his life to retrieve is actually the real-life portrait of editor Sim Evan-Jones father.","Plot similarities between the J.R.R. Tolkien Lord of the Rings trilogy and C.S. Lewis Narnia stories was no coincidence. Both men were members of a literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Living trees that move and fight but also provide a safe zone, languages created for the legendary cultures within the mythology, rescues from towers by flying creatures are a few examples.","Co-producer Douglas Gresham's voice is heard early in the film, as a radio announcer giving news of the German bombings in London. Gresham is C.S. Lewis's stepson, and the executor of Lewis's estate, who manages the rights to the \"Narnia\" books. He is the son of the American poet Joy Gresham, Lewis's wife. (See Shadowlands (1993)).","In the movie Edmund asks if the White Witch can make him taller.

It became a notable landmark for many years during Hollywood's golden era. It actually stood on the lot of the studio on Prospect Avenue near the Sunset & Hollywood Boulevard junctions in the eastern end of the city. It was the first such exterior set ever built in Hollywood. Falling into disrepair, it was eventually torn down. Years later, this same Babylon set was replicated as the central courtyard design for the new Hollywood & Highland complex in Hollywood, which opened in 2001.","After filming wrapped, the Los Angeles Fire Department cited the Babylonian set as a fire hazard and ordered it to be torn down. D.W. Griffith discovered that he had run out of money and was therefore unable to finance its demolition. The set stood derelict and crumbling for nearly four years until it was finally taken down in 1919. By then it had fallen apart enough for it to be dismantled at a sufficiently low cost.","The marriage scenes in the life-of-Christ part of the film were staged and shot according to Jewish tradition, under the supervision of Rabbi Myers. He was the father of Carmel Myers, who played a slave girl in the Babylonian scenes.","During filming of the battle sequences, many of the extras got so into their characters that they caused real injury to each other. At the end of one shooting day, a total of sixty injuries were treated at the production's hospital tent.","A major sub-plot, dealing with a real-life assassination, was cut from the French story before the film's release.","The role of the second Pharisee is credited to Erich von Stroheim. However, von Stroheim did not play this role. D.W. Griffith decided to use von Stroheim's name as a pseudonym for actor William Courtright, who actually plays the role.

That's nearly twice the overall budget of The Birth of a Nation (1915), another D.W.

He was barred from the set that day, apparently because he was so young. While there are several shots of slaves and harem girls throughout the film, the scene that Brown describes is not in any surviving versions.","D.W.

However, assistant director Joseph Henabery said that the walls, which were made of lath and plaster with a lumber frame, were only 100 feet high, as 300-foot-high walls of that material would have blown over with just a light wind. In fact, even at 100 feet high the walls were guyed with steel cables because a fairly stiff breeze would have blown them down.","The extras in the Babylonian scenes were supposedly paid $2.00 a day, per head, an astronomically generous sum at the time. They were also each given a box lunch and had temporary latrine facilities built for them.","The staging and art direction of the Babylonian scenes were largely inspired by the works of 19th century painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema.","Anita Loos claimed that, when writing'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,' she had been inspired to give lead character Lorelei Lee a brief movie career after watching her friends on the set of Intolerance playing Babylonian slave girls.","Howard Gaye, an English actor who played Jesus Christ, got involved in a sex scandal involving a 14-year-old girl and was deported back to England. Because of the scandal, his name was removed from prints of the film at the time.","D.W.

The scene was filmed, but despite his personal sacrifices, Landis eventually also sacrificed the scene.","The original script called for a scene of competitive projectile vomiting (\"booting\") in the Delta House basement. Flounder was going to fail at this repeatedly. Later, after throwing up on Dean Wormer when he's told he's flunked out, Boon congratulates Flounder on his technique.","Stacy Grooman, Flounder's girlfriend Sissy, was actually a student at the University of Oregon at the time the movie was filmed.","Named the #1 comedy on Bravo's \"Funniest 100 Comedies.\"","The movie's line \"Toga!

In addition, the music video for Twisted Sister's \"I Wanna Rock\" features a high school student, clearly based on Flounder, being ridiculed by a teacher (Mark Metcalf again). At the video's conclusion, the principal (played by Stephen Furst) sprays Metcalf in the face with seltzer water.","The characters of Stork and Hardbar were created to give Doug Kenney and Chris Miller a reason to be on set, and had come from different portions of a deleted character named Mountain.

Fawn was a character used in'National Lampoon's 1964 High School Yearbook'.","Professor Jennings bites an apple while lecturing about good and evil in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". This is a deliberate gag reference to Eve's eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, a key event in \"Paradise Lost\" (and referenced too perhaps by the statue pedestal motto seen in the opening titles: \"Knowledge is Good\"). Jennings' students miss the gag - as seems most Animal House (1978) viewers.","During interviews conducted for the 30th anniversary of this film, Karen Allen revealed some interesting trivia about her nude scene. Director John Landis wanted her to bare her bottom in the film and she was very reluctant to do so. Donald Sutherland stepped in and offered to bare his as well. Allen said \"I thought he was so sweet to do that, so I sort of let go of my objections and said,'Okay, if Donald Sutherland is going to bare his bottom, by golly, I'll bare mine too!'\"","Harold Ramis wrote the part of Boon for himself to play, but John Landis felt Ramis was too old. Ramis was so disappointed he refused to accept a smaller part Landis offered him.

The real fraternity members did not like the actors being there and a brawl ensued. When Belushi returned to the set and heard about the fight, he had to be physically restrained from seeking revenge.","The actors who played the Deltas harassed the actors who played the Omegas off-screen as well to keep up the feelings of animosity between their characters. Mark Metcalf changed his hotel room to the one above Bruce McGill's where the Delta actors partied every night so his anger at their noise would help him get into character.","Chris Miller based the character of Pinto on himself. Dean Wormer was based on Richard Nixon and Miller's Dean at Dartmouth.","After the first day's shooting of the homecoming parade, there was a heavy rain that night. The next day, the production crew rented a field-burning tractor that shot flames across the width of the street to dry it.","All of John Belushi's behavior in the cafeteria was improvised. He was not told to pile all the food on his tray and when he did director John Landis urged the camera operator to \"stay with him.\" The infamous \"zit scene\" was also improvised. The reaction from the cast is genuine.","Originally, Harold Ramis and Doug Kenney's idea was titled \"Laser Orgy Girls\", a comedy about Charles Manson as a high school student. Producer Matty Simmons suggested that the setting be changed to college and the content to be toned down. Ramis also incorporated ideas from an earlier treatment he wrote titled \"Freshman Year\" based on his experiences in college.","Ivan Reitman wanted to direct but the studio wanted a more experienced director. Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson were approached before John Landis was hired.","The scene in which Bluto smashes a bottle over his head to cheer Flounder up took 18 takes because Stephen Furst kept laughing.","The Delta actors partied together every night but John Landis kept John Belushi away from them by having him stay in a house miles away with his wife, Judith Belushi-Pisano. Belushi was a notorious partier and Landis wanted him to stay clean throughout the shoot. Belushi did host a few parties at the house but stayed clean because he saw the film as a great opportunity for him.","According to actor James Widdoes (\"Hoover\"), none of the seven principal Delta actors (John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst, Bruce McGill, or Widdoes himself) had ever belonged to a college fraternity.","The final interrupting of the parade sequence was shot on the Universal back lot. This part of the lot had been used in several other films, but the section of road the parade ends up at is the same section that Robert Zemeckis used for the clock tower sequence in Back to the Future (1985). Every angle of this street is used, but never once do you see the front of the clock tower set. The only time you do see the tower is from the back end.","Neidermeyer's horse, Trooper, was portrayed by Junior, who subsequently appeared in The Black Stallion (1979) as the horse Napoleon.","The scene where John Belushi is teaching everyone the \"dirty lyrics\" of The Kingsmen's 1963 song \"Louie Louie\" is based on an actual investigation conducted by the FBI from 1963 to 1965 in which the agency spent more than 2-1/2 years trying to \"decode\" the song because of the supposed profanity that was \"hidden\" in the muffled lyrics. After spending more than two years and tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars, the agency announced that it could find no \"obscene\" words in the song.","The female clerk from whom Flounder (Stephen Furst) buys the marbles is actually his wife.","The core group of Deltas (D-Day, Otter, Boone, Hoover, Flounder, Bluto and Pinto) actually traveled up to the filming site a week early, at director John Landis' request. He wanted the group to emotionally bond so that their friendship would look genuine in the film.","During their bonding week before filming, the seven Deltas partied a lot in their hotel. Bruce McGill actually stole the piano from the hotel's lobby and moved it into his room so that the group would have music.","During filming, John Belushi would often go to local nightclubs to check out the various bands. He was fascinated by a musician named Curtis Salgado. Salgado's sunglasses, harp playing and love of the blues inspired Belushi to form The Blues Brothers with fellow &#x22;Saturday Night Live&#x22; (1975) cast mate Dan Aykroyd.","DeWayne Jessie's performance as \"Otis Day\" was so successful that he legally changed his name to Otis Day, and toured and recorded with'Otis Day and the Knights'.","Sean McCartin, who played the \"Lucky Boy\" who gets a visit from a Playmate, went on to become a pastor at a local church in Cottage Grove, Oregon. A newspaper headline about his story announced \"'Lucky Boy' Still Thanking God\".","Blato teaches new pledges a dirty version of the song \"Louie, Louie.\" A popular urban legend began circulating about the song when people misinterpreted the song as obscene (i.e the lyric \"me gotta go\" became \"grab me way down low,\" to certain ears).","In the scene where Hoover and Bluto are swearing in the new freshman, the book that Hoover is holding is actually an auto repair manual. According to the Animal House backstory, the fraternity's pledge book had actually been destroyed in a fire three years earlier.","In the original script, during the swearing-in scene, the camera was going to show Hoover from the back turning a page in the book in his hands. The page was going to read, \"Engine Manifolds\".","A scene that was cut was Pinto being entertained by Boon and Hoover by telling tales of legendary Delta House frat brothers from years before. The past fraternity brothers had names like Tarantula, Bulldozer, Giraffe, and his girlfriend, Gross Kay.","After firing the crew hairdresser (who wanted extra time off), John Landis took the core Delta actors to a local barbershop and asked the barber if he could do early 1960's style haircuts. The man looked at the pictures and said it would be easy. He did all the actor's haircuts, one after another.","The role of \"Otter\" was originally written for Chevy Chase, who had to turn it down due to prior commitments","SPOILER: Many first-run theatrical releases showed a glimpse of Clorette topless during Pinto's makeout scene right after she drunkenly blurted her age (\"I'm only thirteen\") and passed out, leaving Pinto holding the tissue with which she'd stuffed her bra. By the time home video became widespread, some American obscenity laws forbade showing minors nude in sexual situations - actual or \"depicted\". The latter was meant for illicit composite images, but could be construed to mean acting also.

He then lit the actress from underneath the sheet of glass, and filmed her with a camera mounted on its side, with the lens pointed at a downward angle. This gave the appearance that the actress's hair (with its golden curls, so important to the murderer) was ringed in a halo of light.","For the opening of the film, Alfred Hitchcock wanted to show the Avenger's murder victim being dragged out of the Thames River at night with the Charing Cross Bridge in the background. But Scotland Yard refused his request to film at the bridge. Hitchcock repeated his request several times, until Scotland Yard notified him that they would \"look the other way\" if he could do the filming in one night. Hitchcock quickly sent his cameras and actors out to Charing Cross Bridge to film the scene. But when the rushes came back from the developers, the scene at the bridge was nowhere to be found. Hitchcock and his assistants searched through the prints, but could not find it. Finally, Hitchcock discovered that his cameraman had forgotten to put the lens on the camera before filming the night scene.","Ivor Novello reprised his role in the 1932 sound remake of The Phantom Fiend (1932), directed by Maurice Elvey.

It was in theaters more than three weeks before the first showings of George Pal's Destination Moon (1950).","In the 1970s businessman Wade Williams acquired the rights to Rocketship X-M and proceeded to produce new special effects sequences to take the place of the film's original effects scenes. New shots included a model of the rocket in space, sequences depicting the ship descending toward and taking off from Mars, re-filmed sequences on Mars with new actors, and the use of stock footage of an actual nighttime rocket take-off in the launch sequence at the start of the movie. These sequences were substituted for original footage that was cut from the film, and were seen on the initial VHS and DVD releases in the US. In the 1990s, however, much of this substitute footage was removed and the original scenes restored. The only remaining updated effects sequences occur in the initial launch from Earth, and shots of the rocket landing on and departing from Mars (all of which used stock footage of a V-2 rocket in the original). However, the complete, uncut, original version of the film remains unavailable.","When the film was originally released theatrically in 1950, the sequences on Mars were tinted red so as to impart a sense of the alien Red Planet into the black-and-white film. But subsequent TV prints did not reproduce this effect, and for decades the Martian scenes were shown only in black-and-white until the red tint was restored for home video in the early 1980s.","Rocketship X-M underwent several changes in concept before finally being filmed as it is. Initially, producer-director Kurt Neumann wanted to film a movie about an expedition to Mars that encounters living dinosaurs, but producer Robert L. Lippert rejected the script. Around the same time, special effects man Jack Rabin approached Lippert with a script about a space flight to the moon, to be called'Destination Moon'. Producer George Pal, however, had just copyrighted that title for his own picture about a lunar mission, but Lippert changed his mind and, to take advantage of the publicity for Pal's Destination Moon, brought Neumann's and Rabin's ideas together for his own film about a spaceflight to the moon. Subsequent threats of legal action from Pal forced Lippert to change the venue of his film from the moon back to the planet Mars - the locale in Neumann's original script.","Shots, (in the final reel), of an injured, bandaged, and bare-chested Hugh O'Brien constitute the first \"beefcake\" scene in 1950s sci-fi movies.","SPOILER: The film was originally to have been entitled None Came Back, but writer-producer-director Kurt Neumann changed it to Rocketship X-M because the initial title gave away the film's ending."],"tt0293508":["Both Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson hated filming the water scenes.","The sweeping camera angles during \"All I Ask of You\" made it necessary to shoot multiple takes of the kiss between Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson.

Most of the actors have a background in musicals or opera, but Driver (a skilled singer) had no experience in opera and was dubbed by Margaret Preece, a singing teacher from Solihull, UK. However, Driver did contribute the film's end title song, \"Learn To Be Lonely,\" written specifically for the film by Andrew Lloyd Webber.","The film project was confirmed in 1989. Terry Semel and Bob Daly, then studio bosses at Warner Bros., were \"Phantom\" fans and wanted it filmed. The project was ready to begin filming in 1990 and be released in November 1991; it was set to star Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (the original stars of the stage version). Just before filming began, Andrew Lloyd Webber divorced Brightman and the project was put on hold.","Shekhar Kapur was set to direct at one point.","John Travolta and Antonio Banderas were both considered for the role of the Phantom.

This change has been incorporated into the new Vegas production of the show.","Katie Holmes was almost cast as Christine but the director said she was too old for the part.","The movie was dubbed into Spanish by the actors and singers from the Madrid stage version. The main roles are played by Juan Carlos Barona (The Phantom), Julia Möeller (Christine), Paco Arrojo (Raoul), Yolanda Pérez Segoviano (Mme. Giry), Belén Marcos (Carlotta), Tony Cruz (Firmin), David Venancio Muro (André), Enrique Ferrer (Piangi) and Ana Esther Alborg (Meg Giry). The Spanish lyrics, however, are different from the Madrid version because of the need of lyrics that can be lip-synced with the screen actors.","In April 2004 an audience of the stage version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" in London were asked to stay behind at the end and record the sound effects for the movie. The sounds will be played during the chandelier crash.","The same lead sculptors were used for the making of the film sets and for the original stage show in London.","Neither Gerard Butler nor Emmy Rossum had seen the musical prior to receiving their roles.","When the Phantom is taking Christine to his lair, he places her on a black horse for a while. This is not part of the show, but is a nod to the original book, where the Phantom uses a horse named Cesar to transport Christine part of the way.","Andrew Lloyd Webber composed 15 minutes of new music for the film.","In the beginning of the movie, the retiring owner, Lefevre, says that the only way to please Carlotta is, \"Grovel, grovel\". This is part of a song from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, another one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's shows.","The chandelier weighed 2.2 tons, cost $1.3 million, and was provided by Swarovski. It had a stunt double for riskier scenes. There was also a third chandelier made, that was equipped with electricity and lighting for the opening scene.","The music is played by a 105-piece orchestra.","The Phantom speaks only fourteen of his lines and sings the rest.","In Christine's debut performance as the star of the Opera House, she wears a costume that is an exact replica of the outfit Empress Elizabeth (aka \"Sisi\") of Austria wears in her most famous portrait. This includes the white diaphanous dress with full, billowing skirt, as well as the diamond star-bursts in her hair and earrings. This is not surprising when one considers the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of the most important collectors of artwork from this period, and would be familiar with the portrait in question.","For the auditions, a set was built and the actors wore costume.","Because the chandelier scene is at the end of the film, as opposed to ending the first act as it does in the play, one of the lines in the song \"Masquerade\" had to be altered so that instead of referring to a \"new chandelier\" they talk of \"friends that are here\".","Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was the first to be signed, then Gerard Butler (The Phantom), then Emmy Rossum (Christine).","The theatre fire was an actual fire. Joel Schumacher wanted realism, so they destroyed the theatre for the scene.","The screenplay was written in the south of France in 1989 by Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber.","Emmy Rossum almost didn't get the part because her mother didn't want her to miss her family reunion. Luckily, director Joel Schumacher was able to convince her to leave early in order to sing for Andrew Lloyd Webber.","The lit candelabras that rise from the water were not done with special effects or CGI lights: the special wicks ignited when they reached the air. This effect was done in one take and didn't work again after that.","In the \"Masquerade\" scene, there is a pan up the stairs. When it reaches the top of the stairs, opera patrons dressed in cat masks strike the pose that the cats on the show \"Cats\" pose in any promotional material. \"Cats\" is also an Andrew Lloyd Webber show.","At the end of the Masquerade scene, Raoul briefly enters a circular chamber full of mirrors. This is a reference to the original Phantom of the Opera novel, in which the Phantom used the mirrored chamber as a torture chamber to drive victims insane.","Patrick Wilson did his own stunts.","The instruction to \"Keep your hand at the level of your eyes\" is another reference from the book, in which the Phantom was adept at disposing of victims with the \"Punjab lasso.\" Keeping one's hand at the level of one's eyes kept the Punjab lasso away from the victim's neck and was the only defense.","The doll in the Phantom's lair that is supposed to resemble Emmy Rossum is not actually a wax mold. It is Emmy Rossum. The production produced a mask of her face to use on the mannequin but when they put in the fake eyes it didn't look like her. She suggested to stand in as the mannequin instead. This was done by her being made up like a doll with waxy makeup on, and her standing very, very still.","In very early stages of production, Kevin Spacey was considered for the role of The Phantom.","At the beginning of the movie, the cast is rehearsing for an opera called \"Hannibal\" and they are singing \"Hannibal Comes!\" This is not an actual opera; Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote this for the beginning and wanted to help the actors warm up to the part with a laugh, hence the silly make up and costumes.","When the Phantom leads Christine to his lair for the first time they almost float through a corridor, where human arms hold chandeliers. This is a reference to Beauty and the Beast (1946).","The Phantom's white half-mask prop that Gerard Butler wore for the film sold for £6,450 on eBay.","Gerard Butler's first days of filming were five weeks into production, where he and Emmy Rossum did \"Past the Point of No Return\" which took three days to film.","Andrew Lloyd Webber only insisted that the actors do their own singing, after Joel Schumacher requested that the cast would be relatively young.","A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Anne Hathaway was reportedly the front-runner for the role of \"Christine\". However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn't take the role, which later went to newcomer Emmy Rossum.","Gerard Butler was not the only actor to go through hours of prosthetics: for the look of an older Raoul, Patrick Wilson also went through hours of makeup to look much older than he was for the scenes with Raoul as an old man.","The chandelier used was 17 feet high and 13.2 feet wide, and was hung with more than 20,000 full cut Swarovski crystal pendants. It was produced by Tisserant in Paris, and it took four months to construct and five days to assemble at the studio.","La Carlotta's deep purple outfit is comprised of over twenty-seven meters of silk.","The part where Raoul nearly drowns is also a nod to the original novel, where Erik (The Phantom) floods the torture chamber with water from the lake after Christine agrees to marry him.","The \"Why So Silent\" scene is a reference to Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Masque of the Red Death.\"","The Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's'The Phantom of the Opera' opened at the Majestic Theater on January 26, 1988 and has run for 9125 performances, making this production the longest running show on Broadway (January 2010).

At the time of shooting, Emmy was 16, Patrick Wilson (Rauol) was 30, and Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was 34.","To add to his deformity, Gerard Butler had a string tied just below his eye to cause it to appear more deformed when pulled down. Cast members would often tug on it as a joke between takes.","In an interview on The View, Minnie Driver (Carlotta) says that to master her diva-like Italian accent, she channeled an old neighbor she had when she lived in Venice as a child.","In playing Christine's father in this movie, Ramin Karimloo becomes the first actor to have played all 3 of Christine's loves. Her father in the movie version, and both Raoul and the Phantom on the stage.","Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical \"Phantom of the Opera\" was inspired by Ken Hill's 1976 musical version of the same name. Hill's version is credited as the first Phantom musical and was a success. Sarah Brightman, who later created the role of Christine in Webber's version, was famously asked to play the role of Christine in Hill's 1984 revival but turned down the offer. Webber, who was then married to Brightman, had actually seen Hill's show and asked Hill to collaborate Phantom on a larger scale for the Victoria Palace Theatre in the West End; eventually Webber pursued the musical without Hill. Hill and Webber had previously worked together on a revival of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\".","Meat Loaf was another actor considered for the role of the Phantom.","Since the crew didn't want to have to actually build an Opera House, the exterior is actually a doll house type model that was filmed in a studio. In \"All I Ask of You (Reprise)\", when the Phantom is on the balcony, he is not really there. He was edited in. The footprints in the snow were made on the model where they filmed the camera zooming out and then put in the Phantom.","The casting process began in New York; only singer-actresses under age 25 were even screen-tested. To complicate matters, Andrew Lloyd Webber was happy to go along with Joel Schumacher's insistence on youth but had a demand of his own: \"He said,'Make them unknowns, by all means, Joel, but they must be able to sing,\" Schumacher recalls.","Michael Jackson wanted to play The Phantom himself in the film version. Jackson had a strong interest in musical theater and was a fan of Lloyd Webber's stage adaptation when he saw it open in New York in 1988, in which Jackson saw it several times since and talked to Lloyd Webber backstage. However, Lloyd Webber has said that although Jackson wanted to play the film version of The Phantom, Lloyd Webber felt that it was too early for \"Phantom\" to become a film because the stage musical had just opened at that time.","In the opening auction, the restored chandelier is lot 666 (the \"number of the beast\").","In the show version of \"Prima Donna\" there is no big breath. In the play that is when the Phantom says, \"If these demands are not meant, a disaster upon imagination will occur\". But since they moved that part to \"Notes\" they had to replace it with something - hence the breath.","The score has been translated and recorded in French, Italian, Spanish and German, and the soundtrack has been released internationally in those languages.","According to Jennifer Ellison, Joel Schumacher did not understand much of what she was saying because of of her Liverpool accent.","In the final scene, the year of Christine's death is marked as 1917 on her tombstone.

Michael Riva researched on objects found in prison which could be improvised and used for other purposes (for instance a sock used to make tea), to provide more verisimilitude to the film.","Jon Favreau chose Industrial Light & Magic to provide the film's VFX after watching Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End (2007) and Transformers (2007).","The film's composer Ramin Djawadi's favourite musical score is the \"Kickass\" theme, because he composed it according to \"a rhythm very much like a machine.\"","Most of the exterior scenes set in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes. There, the crew had to endure two days of 40-60 mph winds.","Jon Favreau advised composer Ramin Djawadi to keep the core of the music on heavy guitar, which he felt suited Iron Man best. Djiwadi composed the music on a heavy guitar before arranging it for the orchestra to perform.","According to Terrence Howard, he and Robert Downey Jr. competed physically on the set: \"I'm 40-50 pounds heavier than him, so I'm lifting and I push up about 225 and knocked it out ten times. Robert wanted to go about 235, and he did it, so I push it up to about 245... Robert and his competitive ass almost tore my shoulder trying to keep up with him!\"","An early draft of the script had Howard Stark, Iron Man's father, as a ruthless industrialist who becomes War Machine.","An early draft of the script had the Mandarin appear in the film, re-imagined as an Indonesian terrorist.","Gwyneth Paltrow only needed to travel 15 minutes to get to the studio. She claimed that this is a part of the reason she took the role, as she could be home with her two children during the entire shoot.","The theme song from &#x22;Iron Man&#x22; (1966) is heard four times in the film: in the Apogee Award ceremony, the casino, in Tony Stark's bedroom, and when Stark calls Rhodes.","Stark and Rhodes graduated from MIT together. When Rhodes calls Iron Man, who is flying with the F-22's, you can see a big gold ring on the hand that he's holding the phone in. This is MIT's class ring, the \"brass rat.\"","As a tribute to Howard Hughes, who inspired Iron Man, production was mainly based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista. The scene where the Iron Man Mark III armor was created was filmed in the area where Hughes assembled the H-4 Hercules airplane (better known as \"The Spruce Goose\").","The sound used during a target lock on in Iron Man's Head Up Display (HUD) is the sound of the laser cannon firing in the original Space Invaders game.","The F-22 in the closeup ground shots is serial number 6, deployed to Edwards Air Force Base. This is one of the last \"pre-production\" F-22's, and is one of the first fully operational aircraft. (The first 5 airframes were later retrofitted to also be fully operational). Interestingly, the pole model outside of Stark Industries is labeled as \"YF-22\", meaning the first flying prototype for the competition between the YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23. The size of this pole model indicates that it may be one of the original wind-tunnel models.","Tony Stark's computer system is called JARVIS (standing for \"Just A Rather Very Intelligent System\"). This is a tribute to Edwin Jarvis, Tony Stark's butler. He was changed to an artificial intelligence to avoid comparisons to Batman/Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth.","Agent Phil Coulson repeatedly states he is a member of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (finally shortening it to SHIELD). In the comics, the SHIELD agency originally stood for the Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage/Law-Enforcement Division, then in 1991 was revised to the Strategic Hazard Intervention/Espionage Logistics Directorate.","The film was shipped to some theatres under the titles \"Bell\" and \"Debonair\".","Obadiah Stane plays on the piano a musical piece written by 18th-century composer Antonio Salieri. Salieri is most famously known as a jealous rival of his contemporary, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and was said to have murdered Mozart (although historical records have proven that on the contrary both have collaborated/promoted each other's work on several occasions). This serves as an appropriate parallel of Stark and Stane's relationship in the film.","The leader of the Ten Rings is named Raza, after a Marvel Comics character. However, the comic version of Raza is not an enemy of Iron Man, but an alien cyborg who is a member of the space pirate gang known as the Starjammers. The only similarity they share is their facial disfigurement; in the comics Raza has implants on his left side of his face, while in the film Raza is scarred on the right side of his face.","The assault rifles Tony Stark refers to as'his' are in fact modified G36c rifles. The only thing that has changed on most of these weapons is the barrel and upper receiver, but some haven't been modified much at all apart from the magazine wells.","During the highway battle with Iron Monger, a building can be seen in the background with a Roxxon logo. In the Marvel Universe, Roxxon is a notorious conglomerate known for illegal activities, agents of which were responsible of the death of Stark's parents.","The Stark Industries weapons the terrorists are carrying are actual weapons, but mostly made by German arms firm Heckler & Koch. Many of the terrorists are carrying H&K G36 assault rifles or the smaller UMP sub machinegun. A few are also using Colt M-4s (or various M-4 clones) with various accessories, include ACOG optics, PEQ-2 Infra-Red illuminators, and notably, one terrorist has an M-4 carbine with a 12 gauge Lightweight Shotgun System (LSS) mounted underneath the barrel.","While playing backgammon with Yinsen, Stark says \"Sheesh o Besh. \"This is a Persian slang phrase which means a roll of 6 and 5 (\"Sheesh\" is Persian slang for 6, \"o\" means \"and\" and \"Besh\" is Turkish for 5). Shaun Toub, who plays Yinsen, is of Persian ethnicity.","The pilots in the F-22 jets are codenamed Whiplash'1' and'2'. In the Ultimate Iron Man comics, Whiplash is a super villain who possesses a pair of gloves with steel wires attached that acted as whips. Whiplash himself would appear in Iron Man 2 (2010).","Originally, Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin was going to be the film's villain, but Jon Favreau felt him to be too fantastic and dated, so he was rewritten into a \"working-behind-the-scenes\" presence. Favreau cited \"Star Wars\" as a case: \"I looked at the Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) happen in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977).\"","Jeff Bridges, hearing that Obadiah was a biblical name, researched on the Book of Obadiah in the Bible, and was surprised to learn that a major theme in that particular book is retribution, which Obadiah Stane represents.","The'Industrial Light & Magic' (ILM) animators studied skydivers performing in a vertical wind tunnel to create Iron Man's aerial movements. Iron Man was also animated to take off slowly and land quickly to make those movements more realistic.","To create the shots of Iron Man against the F-22 Raptors, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for the dynamics of wind and frost at that altitude.","The montage of Tony Stark's life story was created by editor Kyle Cooper, and contains real-life photos of a young Robert Downey Jr. and his father.","Just before the final press conference, Tony Stark is reading the newspaper with a grainy, amateur photograph of Iron Man on the cover. The picture is part of a video, shot by onlookers hiding in a bush during initial filming, that appeared on the Internet in 2007.","First film released in 2008 to pass the $300 million mark at the domestic box office.","During the &#x22;Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer&#x22; (2005) segment, the upper (NYSE) and lower (NASDAQ) tickers are filled with quotes of fictional companies named after various Mad Money production staff such as George Manessis (segment producer) and Regina Gilgan (executive producer).","Paul Bettany recorded all his lines as JARVIS in two hours.","This is the last film special effects expert Stan Winston completed before his death.","According to Paul Bettany, he did not know which film he was working on; he merely did the job as a favor for Jon Favreau, whom he worked with on Wimbledon (2004).","Rock guitarist Tom Morello assisted Ramin Djawadi in composing the film's soundtrack. Morello himself has a cameo in the film as a security guard who gets killed by the Iron Monger (perhaps fittingly, since Morello is a member of the band Rage Against the Machine).","It took around 17 years to get the film into development. Originally, Universal Pictures were to produce the film in April 1990. They later sold the rights to 20th Century Fox. Later, Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema. Finally, Marvel Studios decided to handle their own creation.","Harry Gregson-Williams was offered the job of scoring the film, but he had to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008).","Comic book writers Mark Millar, Brian Bendis, Joe Quesada, Tom Brevoort, Axel Alonzo and Ralph Macchio were commissioned by Jon Favreau to give advice on the script.","One of the cars in Tony Stark's garage is an all-electric Tesla Roadster, which had not yet been released during the film's production.","Tony's and Christine's short conversation before she hands him the pictures: \"Carrie? Christine!\", is a joke referring to two of Stephen King's most-acclaimed novels.","According to Jon Favreau, Clive Owen and Sam Rockwell are among the actors that were considered for Tony Stark during pre-production. Rockwell would get a part in Iron Man 2 (2010) as Stark's rival Justin Hammer.","EASTER EGG: In the Region 1 DVD disc 1, Special Features section, there is a hidden circle icon (not Iron Man's arc generator, oddly enough) between the \"Previews\" and \"Main Menu\" items (on a DVD remote, highlight \"Main Menu\", then go left). Press Enter to see a video of Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr. discussing Lee's cameo in the film.","The actress taking part in the screen test with Robert Downey Jr., which can be seen in the extras, is Sasha Alexander.","Jon Favreau wanted Robert Downey Jr. because he felt the actor's past was right for the part. He commented: \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark. Robert brings a depth that goes beyond a comic book character having trouble in high school, or can't get the girl.\" Favreau also felt Downey could make Stark \"a likable asshole\", but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.","The roadster that Tony Stark was working on is actually owned by director Jon Favreau.","In the comics, the chauffeur Harold \"Happy\" Hogan is a confidante of Tony Stark who later marries Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts after a tragedy draws them closer.","There are various references in the film towards the Mandarin, Iron Man's arch-nemesis:- the organization that kidnaps Stark is called \"the Ten Rings,\" after the ten rings that comprise the Mandarin's arsenal (Jon Favreau has stated that The Ten Rings, in fact, works for The Mandarin)- the commandant Raza speaks of Genghis Khan and Asia- Raza is seen occasionally fiddling with an ornate gold ring- rings are worn by Stark, Stane, Rhodes and Raza (that is to say those in positions of power).","Obadiah Stane tells Tony Stark \"We're iron mongers, we make weapons.\" Stane's supervillain moniker is the Iron Monger, and thus foreshadows Stane's own transition in the film to an armour-clad antagonist.","The film's property master Russell Bobbitt, won Hamilton's \"Behind the Camera Award 2008\" for the props he created on Iron Man.","The Stark Industries logo is similar to that of Lockheed Martin, codeveloper of the F-22 Raptor.","When Pepper looks through the records on Stark's computer, the files mention \"missiles transported via the MSC Lebowski\" and \"legal ownership of mammots within city limits.\" These terms refer to Jeff Bridges's previous film The Big Lebowski (1998).","The code that appears on the computer screen at 34 minutes into the movie is an utility that downloads firmware into Lego robotic toy (called RCX). It may suggest that Tony Stark used this program to download firmware into his robotic suit.","The 3-digit code that Pepper inputs to enter Tony's lab (where she has to pull out his heart generator) is 106. (at 49 min 15 sec into the movie)","When designing Tony Stark's house, the guideline the designers were given was to make it more \"grease monkey\" (inventor/mechanic) than futuristic, in order to keep the film realistic. J. Michael Riva took inspiration from the photographs of Julius Schulman, who was noted for photographs of 1950s and 1960s Los Angeles homes.","When Obadiah Stane watches Rhodey on TV, an expensive chess set is visible on the table in front of him. In the comics, Obadiah Stane was fond of playing chess, and also created a group called the Chessmen to attack Stark Industries.","For the \"Iron Man\" trilogy, Jon Favreau thought of making the Iron Monger the main villain of the second film. Stane was going to be Stark's friend and confidante in the first film, but then would become his enemy in the second installment. However, Favreau was worried how to handle The Mandarin, whom was to be the villain of the first film, so he decided to re-work the character into a behind-the-scenes presence and make Iron Monger the first villain.","When Tony Stark is falling after his escape from the terrorists, the sound effect is that of Wile E. Coyote falling from the Looney Tunes cartoons.","Director Jon Favreau played a character similar to Tony Stark named Pete Becker on the hit television series &#x22;Friends&#x22; (1994). Both Stark and Becker are rich playboys who give up their current life to fight, Tony fights crime while Pete fights in Ultimate Fighting. Favreau even sported Stark-like facial hair for the role.","There are about five sets of armor in the film, all inspired from the \"Iron Man\" comics:- the Mark I armor, Stark's first suit, is a simple suit constructed of iron.- the Mark II armor is a silver suit, the prototype Stark develops (this can also be counted as the War Machine armor, as Rhodes looks speculatively at it).- the Mark III armor is the final red/gold armor.- JARVIS first presents the Mark III armor in full gold, the look pays tribute to the all-gold \"Golden Avenger\" armor Iron Man wore early in his career.- JARVIS later presents the armor in silver and red, making it look almost identical to Iron Man's \"Silver Centurion\" armor that he wore in the 1980s.","The scene where Pepper helps Tony replace his arc reactor was filmed using a prosthetic chest, joined to Robert Downey Jr.'s own chest and projecting out at an angle, while Robert was'in' the back of the seat he was sitting on. A bright light was positioned shining on the area to hide any potential'edges' of the fake chest-piece. A similar method was used in Star Trek: First Contact (1996) when we first see the Borg Queen.","According to Phil Saunders, Tony Stark would develop a Mark IV armor, which would have been used in the final battle. This Mark IV armor would become the War Machine armor, and had swap-out armaments that would be worn over the Mark III armor however, halfway through pre-production the concept was removed from the script.","To prepare for her role as Pepper Potts, Gwyneth Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics to her understanding of the character.","Gwyneth Paltrow based her performance on 1940s heroines (who she claimed were sexy, witty and innocent all at once).","Director Jon Favreau voiced Iron Man in the &#x22;Robot Chicken&#x22; (2005) episode \"Two Weeks Without Food.\"","Adi Granov designed a billboard poster of Iron Man's nemesis, the alien dragon Fin Fang Foom, for the film. This poster can be seen when Stark, while testing the Mark II armor, flies straight down a road (on Stark's left side).","During the final battle, there was originally going to be a sequence where Tony, in the Iron Man suit, drives an Audi R8 that would crash into Iron Monger's legs then flip over, after which Iron Man would split the car in half and jump out. However, the Audi R8 was so well-built that it refused to flip despite repeated crashes and the roof wouldn't split the way the Director wanted it to because the car's frame was so tough. As a result, the whole final fight sequence was re-written. The filmmakers were so impressed by the toughness of the car that it was decided that the convertible version was to be featured in the sequel.","Timothy Olyphant read for the role of Tony Stark.","SPOILER: The climactic showdown in the film, with Tony Stark/Iron Man facing Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is adapted from Iron Man #200, published in November, 1986. Both pit Stane's larger, more powerful Iron Monger against Stark's greater experience, and both feature an exploding reactor. However, the comic concludes with Stane committing suicide with a repulsor ray blast to the head.","SPOILER: In the Ultimate Marvel Comics series, the character of Nick Fury is portrayed as African American, with his look and personality tailored after actor Samuel L. Jackson, all carried out with the actor's explicit permission. During one of the Ultimate Avengers issues, whilst discussing the possibility of a movie being made about them and which actors would play which heroes, Nick Fury even comments that nobody else but Samuel L. Jackson could play him. Jackson, himself a comic book fan, plays Fury in this film.","SPOILER: Brian Bendis had written three pages of dialogue for the Nick Fury scene, out of which the filmmakers chose the best lines. To keep it a secret, the scene was filmed with a skeleton crew and was deleted from all previews of the film, which thus maintained the mystery and surprise and kept fans speculative and interested. It conclusively appeared in the final cut as a post-credits scene.","SPOILER: Nick Fury wants to talk to Tony Stark about the Avengers Initiative. This is a reference to the Avengers, a team of superheroes assembled in the 1960-70s, and foreshadows a live-action Avengers film. Iron Man is a founding member of the Avengers, along with the Hulk, Ant-Man, Wasp and Thor.","SPOILER: The final scene, in which Tony reveals to the press that he is Iron Man is a reference to the Avengers Disassembled mini-series. In the mini-series (part 1), which was written by Brian Bendis, Stark, under the influence of Scarlet Witch, revealed himself to be the Secretary of Defense to the entire delegates of the UN, with the exact line spoken in the film.","SPOILER: Tony Stark says \"I am Iron Man\" in the final scene. This is a homage to the series &#x22;Iron Man&#x22; (1994), whose theme song had the lyrics \"I am Iron Man!\"","SPOILER: Tony Stark went on to appear in The Incredible Hulk (2008), chatting to General Ross in a bar about \"putting a team together.\" This makes these two films the first Marvel films to establish a direct link between each other, thus setting up a Marvel film-universe where characters can appear in each others' films (regardless of which studio holds the rights). This movie-verse will be the setting for The Avengers (2012), which centers on a group made of many different heroes."],"tt0047507":["Director-producer W. Lee Wilder (and his son, the film's screenwriter'Miles Wilder') deliberately took the name of the police detective, Lt.

Vlademar Tymrak was a serial-killer and evil spirit in &#x22;Tales from the Crypt: Report from the Grave (#7.8)&#x22; (1989), which was also directed by Malone.","The first person to be killed in the movie is screenplay writer Dick Beebe.","The inscriptions on the walls and doors in the hospital are all in German, but do not make any particular sense when translated. The inscription \"Gehirn Hygiene\" for example is a rough translation of the English \"brain sanitation\" into German. Maybe the German inscriptions were just supposed to add a more gothic atmosphere to the movie, but quite certainly they are also a reference to an old German Horror movie The Haunted Castle (1921) directed by F.W. Murnau, which also deals with a haunted manor.","Cindy Crawford was considered for the role of Melissa Margaret Marr.","Famke Janssen performed her own stunt when the glass ceiling breaks. It was extremely important for Janssen to remain where she was and very still, yet even with her basically glued to the spot, the shard hit with so much impact that it bounced her head off the table as you can see on close inspection of the scene.","William Malone got the idea to set the movie in a former insane asylum when he was filming an episode of &#x22;Tales from the Crypt&#x22; (1989) in a former asylum and noticed that crew members were running scared out of the basement, not wanting to film there.","Co-producer Terry Castle is the daughter of William Castle, who directed the 1959 version of the film.","Geoffrey Rush was never meant to look like Vincent Price (star of the original film House on Haunted Hill (1959)). The original screenplay described Stephen Price as a regular looking businessman. Rush didn't care for this, so he suggested that his character look like the film director John Waters. The director agreed to test this look out. After his transformation, he ended up looking so much like Vincent Price the director decided to keep the look.","Marc Blucas and Ivana Milicevic filmed a short \"movie in a movie\" sequence which was cut from the theatrical release, but appears in the deleted scenes section of the DVD release.","Elizabeth Hurley was considered for the role of Evelyn Stockard-Price.","Despite the fact that this was filmed in the standard spherical format, \"Filmed in Panavision\" is listed in the end credits.","SPOILER: When creating the black \"evil\" that attacks the surviving cast at the end of the film, the animators used images of nude women.

It reads: \"...I find that one or two critics (not The New York Times) question why the story was written....I wrote Three Came Home for three reasons: For horror of war. I want others to shudder with me at it. For affection of my husband. When war nearly killed me, knowledge of our love kept me alive. And for a reminder to my son. I fought one war for him in prison camp.

Paradoxically though, Agnes Newton Keith also hated Suga for the starvation, torture and degradation that he inflicted in the prisoner-of-war camp.","Writer-Producer Nunnally Johnson wanted this film adaptation of the book by Agnes Newton Keith to be true to the memoir and realistically capture the harrowing ordeal of Keith and her fellow POWs.

The attack by the Hurons after the surrender was directed at the colonial militia and its Indian allies. Munro and the British regulars were at the head of the column under the protection of French soldiers and did not know that the column had been attacked until they arrived at Ft. Edward.

Due to the expansive area involved, loudspeakers were installed around the battlefield and fort so directions could be easily given to the hundreds of cast and crew.

The dramatically down-turned \"Roman-nosed\" stock is a hallmark of the Allentown-Bethlehem area school, the rifle in the film being very similar to works created by several well-known gunsmiths from that tradition in 18th and early 19th century.

Edelman would provide about twenty-eight and a half minutes. Edelman was then in charge of assembling the music for the new cut of the film which clocked in at about 114 minutes which included Jones' music, Edelman's and all the source material by Daniel Lanois and Clannad. Jones and Edelman did not work together on the score which is why their names on the credits are separate from one another. The subsequent soundtrack album also represents this as Jones' music is separated from Edelman's as the album's first half is Jones' score followed by Edelman's and ending with Clannad's song to round it out. All told with their musical contributions to the film, Jones and Edelman's score combined round out to approximately seventy-eight minutes without the source music.","According to Randy Edelman's 1996 Film Score Monthly interview, he came on board because of creative differences between Trevor Jones and Michael Mann which forced Jones off the project. \"The movie was over budget, there was a mess with the studio, etc. The only reason Morgan Creek got the rights to not just the music and the album but all the overseas rights is because the whole situation was out of control.

However, for the sequels, Romero has treated the timeline of the Dead saga with a bit of malleability; in the movie novelization of Dawn of the Dead he notes \"The stock market had plummeted way below the lowest point of the Carter administration\" and refers to an upcoming election. Day of the Dead features a copy of the novel Salem's Lot, published in 1975, after Night of the Living Dead came out; it seems peculiar that this publish still saw publication in a world where \"ghouls\" actually exist. Diary of the Dead takes place isochronally with Night of the Living Dead yet features modern computers. Of course, even Night of the Living Dead references technology far advanced than that available at the time of the film's release (i.e. the Venus probe).","The body upstairs in the house was made by director George A. Romero, who used ping-pong balls for the eyes.","S. William Hinzman based his characteristic saunter (and, subsequently, that of each other zombie) on a film with Boris Karloff, the title of which he could not remember. In that film, Karloff played a man risen from the dead, and walks with a characteristic ungainly saunter.","According to the George A. Romero commentary track on the Elite laserdisc and DVD version of the film, the original working print and working elements and materials for the film no longer exist - they were destroyed as a result of a flood that filled the basement where the materials were stored (which was the same basement used in the movie).","At between 51 and 52 minutes into the film, going by the Elite laserdisc/DVD release, there is a very visible jump cut. The distributors wanted some of the \"talky\" bits trimmed down, so, about 6 minutes was cut from a basement scene involving the Coopers. The jump is quite clearly visible because at one point Harry is facing one direction and then immediately in the next frame, he is facing another.","At the time of the film's release, any work that did not include a copyright notice was assumed to be public domain. Since the film makers forgot to include this notice, the film slipped into the public domain. In was not until 1 March 1989 that a copyright notice was no longer required.","Screenwriter John A.

However contrary to what is elsewhere reported (and was previously reported here on IMDb) Marilyn Eastman (wife Helen Cooper is not in any way related to either Karl or Kyra.","This was one of the first films added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress because of naïve business practices that allowed the copyright of the film to slip into the public domain.","The filmmakers were accused of being \"Satanically-inspired\" by Christian fundamentalist groups for their portrayal of the undead feeding on flesh and of the Coopers' zombie child (Kyra Schon) attacking her mother (Marilyn Eastman).","One of the original ideas for the script before its many revisions called for Barbara to be a very strong, charismatic character. Instead, George A. Romero and the producers loved Judith O&#x27;Dea's portrayal as a catatonic and terrified young girl much better, and edited the script to accommodate the part. Eventually, the idea of Barbara being a strong, central character would be revisited in Tom Savini's 1990 remake.","The stock music that accompanies Barbara's initial flight from the cemetery zombie was taken from the score for The Hideous Sun Demon (1959), and had been used a year earlier, in the final episode of television's &#x22;The Fugitive&#x22; (1963).","As George A. Romero explains it on \"The Directors: The Films of George A. Romero\", the day the final editing and voice-over dubbing was complete (4/4/1968), he and John A. Russo literally \"threw\" the film into the trunk of their car and drove to New York to see if anyone wanted to show it. While driving through New York on the night of April 4th, 1968, Romero and Russo heard news on the radio that Martin Luther King had been assassinated.","The role of Ben was originally meant for Rudy Ricci. After Duane Jones had read the part, however, it was given to him, and Ricci played one of the zombies.","In the scene where Ben moves the body upstairs to another room, we can see that its face is intact. This was in fact Kyra Schon who doubled as the upstairs body as it was felt that a mannequin would look unrealistic.","This film is ranked at #9 on Bravo's _\"100 Scariest Movie Moments, The\" (2004) (mini)_ special.","Filmed at Tim Hornish's grandmother's house in Zelionople.","The character of Ben was originally written as an angry person. When Duane Jones was given the role, he expressed concern that the character be rewritten to remove some of the anger - such as the scene where Ben hits Barbara - afraid of how it would be widely perceived in the United States at the time to see a black man acting in this way. The nation was still plagued with high racial tensions during the late sixties; the film was released to theaters shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Nonetheless, George A. Romero and most of the rest of the predominantly white crew decided against it, thinking they were being \"hip\" by not changing it. Years later, Romero lamented that he had not taken Jones' concerns more into consideration, and thought that he was probably correct. He's expressed that he wishes he could speak with the late Jones again, asking him how he felt about the film's legendary status, and believes Jones would just say \"Who knew?\" and laugh.","Though the cast and crew of the film had nothing but positive things to say about Duane Jones (Ben), Marilyn Eastman (Helen Cooper) would later refer to him as a tortured individual, due to the racial tensions which were still high in the United States during the late sixties. Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper) had become good friends with Jones, and Jones' unfortunate death in 1988 affected him greatly. He would often become emotional when talking about Jones, and believed he received a rotten deal in life due to the nation's racial tensions.","When applying makeup for the actors playing zombies, Marilyn Eastman focused less on a rotting appearance for most of them (it can still be seen on several, including herself in the \"bug-eating\" scene), instead concentrating on a prominent facial feature that each actor or actress had and making it appear more prominent for an unsettling image.","The matricide scene was accomplished by having Kyra Schon stab repeatedly into a off-screen pillow with a trowel while a member of the effects crew threw chocolate syrup (used as fake blood for a black-and-white film) onto the wall. These scenes were looped with scenes of Marilyn Eastman screaming. The trowel used in the scene was purchased online years later and is now in a private collection.","SPOILER: The social commentary on racism some have seen in this film was never intended (an African-American man holing up in a house with a white woman, a posse of whites shooting a black man in the head without first checking to see if he was a zombie). According to the filmmakers, Duane Jones was simply the best actor for the part of Ben.","SPOILER: Barbara (Judith O&#x27;Dea) was originally meant to be the sole survivor of the zombies' onslaught. This idea is incorporated into the remake of Night of the Living Dead (1990).","SPOILER: Originally, one idea for the script called for Harry Cooper to die from the gunshot wound received from Ben before his daughter became a zombie, which would have resulted in Helen coming down the stairs to find him eating their daughter, rather than the daughter eating him. It was decided that this would probably be far too disturbing and graphic and was changed back to the idea of the daughter becoming a zombie first."],"tt0019421":["The stunt where the wall falls on Buster Keaton was performed with an actual full-weight wall. Half the crew walked off the set rather than participate in a stunt that would have killed Keaton if he had been slightly off position.

However, due to a real Mississippi flood and bickering amongst the producers, the flood plot was changed to a \"cyclone.\"","This movie was used as a model for Steamboat Willie (1928), Mickey Mouse's first cartoon with sound.","During the hurricane sequence, there is a scene that pays homage to Buster Keaton's childhood on the vaudeville stage. One brief moment has a table move in the wind, apparently animating the dummy and turning its head to face Keaton. Keaton is startled and runs. This is based on a real experience from when he was a kid and became fascinated with a dummy named Red Top, who belonged to ventriloquist Trovollo. The young Keaton had a \"conversation\" with the dummy and conspired to kidnap his new friend one night when the theater was empty. Trovollo, anticipating Keaton, slipped to his props offstage and when Keaton approached, brought Red Top to life, scaring Keaton out of the theater.","This and The General (1926) are generally considered by critics to be Buster Keaton's last great films. Shortly after these two were made, the independent-minded Keaton made the mistake of signing a contract with MGM, whose regimented ways clashed with his scrupulous perfectionism. Five years after MGM hired him, it dropped his contract and Keaton drifted into obscurity, complicated by a severe drinking problem, from which he didn't emerge for many years.","Marion Byron could not swim, so the scenes where her character is in the river with Buster Keaton were filmed with Buster's real-life sister Louise Keaton serving as Marion's stunt double.

This is not true for several reasons. First, there were two competing and incompatible sound systems. The Vitaphone process was cumbersome, relying on an electro-mechanical interface between the projector and the turntable. Fox's Fotofilm was a superior sound-on-film process that allowed for easier editing but required a costlier projector (the Vitaphone system would be quietly killed off by 1932). Secondly, either sound process nearly doubled the budget of a film. Thirdly, theater chains faced enormous conversion costs (MGM-parent company Loew's Inc. owned over 1,000 outlets, and took a deliberately slow wait-and-see attitude toward sound). The first feature film with all synchronous dialog was Lights of New York (1928). Also, in the midst of the talkie-craze of 1928-30, studio bosses were faced with a limited amount of sound equipment and qualified sound technicians, causing them innumerable headaches over which productions to produce as talkies vs. silents. Also, silents were internationally marketable via cheap title card translations while talkies, prior to the advent of subtitles, usually required completely different foreign language versions to be produced simultaneously. Low budget producers of westerns along poverty row were especially impacted, with silents continuing in that market through the end of 1930. Many studios continued to produce both silent and sound versions of their films, including the classic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930).","George Jessel, star of the stage version, was asked to play the role in the film, but refused over a pay dispute. Eddie Cantor was also asked, and also refused.","Al Jolson's famous line \"you ain't heard nothin' yet\" was an ad-lib. The intention was that the film should only have synchronized music, not speech, but Jolson dropped in the line (which he used in his stage act) after the song \"Dirty Hands, Dirty Face\". The director wisely left it in.","Warner Brothers quietly threw in the towel on the Vitaphone disk process in 1932. Not wanting to risk losing the disks, Warner Bros. had all of the Vitaphone sound for the film transferred to optical tracks on the side of the film itself in the 1930s.","Myrna Loy is briefly glimpsed as a chorus girl in one scene.","The world premiere was at the Tower Theater in Los Angeles.","Sam Warner, the Warner Brother, that was nicknamed the \"Father of the Talkies\", because he insisted that Al Jolson's ad-libbed speech be included in the movie, died on Wednesday, October 5th, 1927, just one day before the film debuted, to the remaining cast and crew, on Thursday, October 6th, 1927.","The movie's line \"Wait a minute, wait a minute.

In the original 1978 radio version and in &#x22;The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&#x22; (1981), it was \"a fiver\".","After Jay Roach decided to pass on directing the movie, he brought the property to Spike Jonze. Jonze also passed, but suggested Nick Goldsmith and Garth Jennings (also known as Hammer and Tongs, also soon-to-be former music video directors), who accepted.","Jack Davenport was considered for the role of Arthur Dent, but in the end it was decided he was simply too good-looking for the role of the ultimate everyman Dent. Douglas Adams had originally wanted Hugh Grant to also play Arthur, but the idea was nixed.","A painting of Douglas Adams and his wife Jane Belson appears on the Heart of Gold. Other Adams cameos include a few handles on some cupboards in Humma Kavula's office being shaped like Adams' nose.","The car that Ford Prefect \"introduces himself to\" is actually a Ford Prefect, from whence Ford got his \"Earth name\". Despite being a Ford, the car was never manufactured or sold in the United States, but produced in Ireland, the UK, Malaysia and New Zealand, and sold in Europe, Asia and Australia between 1938 and 1959.","Belgium (which, according to the original radio series, is the most unspeakably rude word there is) can be heard in the movie three or so times.","The Vogon written language seen on their release forms as well as in a bilingual caption in the Magrathean video which says \"Information Deleted\", is actually a form of English. Pitman shorthand, once taught to hundreds of thousands of office-workers mainly in the British Commonwealth, is a series of straight and curved strokes meant to write down sounds much faster than regular writing. As discussed in a book about the movie, the Vogons use a slightly blocky but recognizable form of \"Pitman 2000\", the most recent version of Pitman shorthand published in 1970. It occurs in the Vogon release forms, posters on the wall which say \"Fire Exit Escape Map\" (over a hopelessly confusing maze of arrows with a spot at the center saying \"You Are Here\") and \"Are you depressed? Destruction Therapy!\"","Shada, the prison planetoid of the Time Lords, can be seen in the background during the factory floor scene on Magrathea. Shada was featured in an un-aired serial of &#x22;Doctor Who&#x22; (1963) that Douglas Adams wrote. Characters and settings from \"Shada\" appeared in Douglas Adams' novel \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detection Agency\", which was mostly a version of the same story Adams had used for a 1979 &#x22;Doctor Who&#x22; (1963) serial,\"City of Death\".","In one shot, the Apple Mac logo is visible on the side of Deep Thought, the giant computer. Douglas Adams owned the first two Apple Macintosh computers delivered to the United Kingdom, while Stephen Fry (the voice of the Book) owned the third. Both men were/are keen advocates of the Mac.","The Magrathean holomessage appears as if it would become three dimensional with red/green 3-D glasses, but it is only a gimmick. It doesn't actually become 3D, and if you look closely, he's only rimmed with red and blue. If it were a real 3D effect his whole face would be blurred with red/blue overlays.","The initial scene, with the dolphins prancing about, is a dolphin show in the \"Loro Parque\" Zoo, in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain - which is also the only place in Europe to feature an \"Orca Ocean\", as well as having the largest parrot collection in the world.","The phone which Arthur uses in the first part of the film is a Nokia 7610.","The hymn sung by the Jatravartidian followers of Humma Kavula was recorded at St. Martin's Church, Highgate, London on 19 June 2004. The hymn was sung by several hundred untrained members of the public invited to the recording via a call for singers circulated on the Internet.","In a chaotic scene shot in London, fans can spot Douglas Adams's brother James Thrift, sister Jane Garnier and daughter Polly Jane Rocket Adams rushing about in the general panic, as the earth is destroyed by the Vogons.","Bill Murray, Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp (a huge Douglas Adams fan) were also considered for the part of Zaphod Beeblebrox, along with Will Ferrell. But after Sam Rockwell's audition, director Garth Jennings immediately chose him.","The pub which Ford takes Arthur to in the beginning of the film is the Beehive Pub of Hertfordshire, England.","When Ford and Zaphod first greet each other on the Heart of Gold, Zaphod calls Ford \"Ix\" and then quickly corrects himself. In the novel, \"Ix\" was a nickname that Ford's childhood schoolmates gave him, which, according to the book, translates as \"boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven.\"","The old lady sitting at the street side table oblivious to or uninterested in what's going on around her is Douglas Adams's mother. The director didn't give any acting directions to her or anybody else in the scene for what they were suppose to do, to simulate chaos, so she just sat there reading a newspaper.","The fancy dress party contains several references to Douglas Adams' 40th birthday party. At the real party, Adams introduced Darwinian Evolutionist Richard Dawkins to the future Mrs Dawkins, actress Lalla Ward. In the film, Arthur is seen reading Dawkins' book, \"The Selfish Gene\", when he meets Tricia, who is dressed as Charles Darwin. Adams and Dawkins became very good friends after Adams received a fan letter from him.","The producers have stated that this film is not a literal translation of the books (just as the books were not a literal translation of the original radio show), but all of the new ideas and characters came from Douglas Adams himself. The hired writer simply came aboard to improve structure and make the screenplay more coherent.","Cameo: [Simon Jones ]  who played Arthur the radio show and TV's &#x22;The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&#x22; (1981) (and was, in fact, originally hand-picked by friend Douglas Adams for the role), makes a brief appearance as the Magrathean \"greeting/threat\" holomessage. This marks another slight deviation from the other Guide incarnations, as all other versions used the actor who played Slartibartfast for the holomessage.","Some additional shots were filmed to fit in with Arthur waking up at the beginning of the movie. In one shot (included in an early trailer, but cut from the film, and not on the DVD), Arthur's identification as a BBC employee can be seen. The original Hitch Hiker's radio and TV versions were produced by the BBC.","Easter Egg: The DVD includes an \"Improbability Drive\" item on every menu. Clicking this takes you to a random point in one of the bonus features. If you use it several times, you get to see a strange cartoon, which is apparently the same one Deep Thought watches in the movie.","The relevance of Sector ZZ9 is the fact that in the UK if a person has NFA (No fixed Abode (No place to live)) then the POSTCODE is recorded as ZZ99 3VZ, thus Both Trillian and Arthur come from Sector ZZ9 and thanks to the Vogons they are both of NFA.","Several minutes into the credits, a final Guide entry is shown. This is the \"careless words/problem of scale\" entry, well known to fans of other incarnations of the Guide.","When Ford and Arthur drink at the pub early in the film, a middle-aged blonde can be seen watching them. According to the DVD commentary, this actress (Su Elliot) played Trillian in the London stage version of the story - a fact the director was unaware of until the day of shooting.","The scene in which Arthur learns the Guide's sole entry for earth is \"Harmless\" and that the updated version was to be \"Mostly Harmless\" was filmed but didn't make the final cut (it is included as a bonus deleted scene on the DVD). It would have been seen when Arthur and Ford arrive on the Vogon ship.","One major change originally made for the film (and apparently the only one not originating from Douglas Adams) was that Trillian was to have been revealed as being only half-human. This plot point is referenced in pre-release publicity including the film-tie-in reissue of the original novel, cast and director interviews and the official \"making of\" book. Before release, however, this plot point was deleted from the film.","During the scene where the Vogons are preparing to destroy earth, a large radio dish can be seen (surrounded by a sheep paddock). It is the Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope in Cheshire, England.","The names of all five books - Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life the Universe and Everything, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, and Mostly Harmless - are each mentioned throughout the course of the movie. The last, however, ended up on the cutting room floor and can be seen in the Deleted Scenes of the DVD.","Oliver Postgate auditioned for the voice of the Book.","When hurriedly giving possible questions to what the answer 42 might mean Arthur's suggestion of \"How many roads must a man walk down?\" is a reference to the Bob Dylan song \"Blowin' In The Wind\". It's the opening line to the song.","Sam Rockwell has said in interviews that his portrayal of Zaphrod was influenced by three people: Bill Clinton, Elvis Presley and Vince Vaughn.","Faint screams can be heard a moment before Mr. Prosser speaks. In the book, Mr. Prosser is a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, the reason why he wears little fur hats and often hears a thousand hairy horsemen shouting in his head.","As the emergency escape pod crashes on Vogsphere, the sound made by it is the same as the plane from the end of'In the Flesh' the first track on Pink Floyd's The Wall. Douglas Adams was a personal friend of Pink Floyd and even played at one of their shows.","The nightgown/bathrobe Arthur Dent wore was the most expensive and difficult of all costumes (including Zaphod's heads and Humma's eyes). The fabric had to be sewn on stage and was flown in from Turkey.","Deep Thought reveals the answer to the ultimate question 42 minutes into the film.","According to Douglas Adams' notes, he wanted the name of the character \"Slartibartfast\" to sound extremely rude, but still pass BBC's rules on what could be broadcast - he actually started with \"Phartiphukborlz\" and changed it, bit by bit, until it was acceptable.","Both actors who play Marvin in the movie (Alan Rickman as his voice, Warwick Davis as his body) portray Hogwarts professors in the Harry Potter series (Rickman as Severus Snape and Davis as Filius Flitwick).","Despite the fact that this was filmed in Super 35, \"Filmed in Panavision\" is listed in the end credits.","SPOILER: As the Heart of Gold Spaceship travels through \"improbability\" it quickly transforms into many strange shapes (including a rubber duck) in the very final transformation at the end of the film it quickly transforms into the face of author/creator Douglas Adams."],"tt0056211":["In addition to her credited role in the mask as \"The Hag,\" Vampira - as Maila Nurmi - also played (uncredited) the role of the sorceress who kidnaps Princess Helene.","Stuntman/actor Leroy Johnson (Sir Ulrich of Germany) had his dialog dubbed by voice specialist Paul Frees."],"tt0026759":["Bela Lugosi shot this feature in England after \"The Raven,\" and prior to \"The Invisible Ray.\" Filming lasted from mid July-August 1935.","Only the second production from Hammer Films, who did just four features in the 1930s before going into hiatus until 1946."],"tt0042313":["Rico Alaniz' film debut."],"tt0049900":["The enormous popularity of Toho's giant monster films led Daiei to issue publicity stills showing the Pairans as gigantic creatures that towered over buildings. In the film, the Pairans are human sized.","This film wasn't released in the United States until 1967.","This was the first color tokusatsu science fiction film produced in Japan. It beat Toho's science fiction spectacle, Ishir&#xF4; Honda's The Mysterians (1957) (the first tokusatsu film in widescreen), into theaters by a year."]}
