Exploitation filmmakers hoped to capitalize on the taboo subjects of venereal disease, sex before marriage, lesbianism, etc. while skirting the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 which forbade a film from containing such content. Films like this would tour the United States for years - mostly being shown in rundown, skid row theaters. This film has been re-edited and re-titled (\"Human Wreckage\", \"They Must Be Told\", \"Trial Marriage\", \"About Trial Marriage\") many times to attract the same audience to film, to take advantage of a taboo subject which may have gotten press recently or to appease local censors who disapproved of the film's content.

The Code forbade the portrayal of immoral acts like drug use. (<i>The illegal drug traffic must not be portrayed in such a way as to stimulate curiosity concerning the use of, or traffic in, such drugs; nor shall scenes be approved which show the use of illegal drugs, or their effects, in detail.</i>) The film toured around the country for many years - often being re-edited and re-titled (\"Tell Your Children\", \"Dope Addict\", \"Doped Youth\", \"Love Madness\", \"The Burning Question\"). It was re-discovered in the early 1970s by NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and screened again as an example of the government's demonization of marijuana. NORML may have been confused about the film's sponsorship since one of the film's distributors, Dwain Esper, testified to the Arizona Supreme Court that \"Reefer Madness\" was not a trashy exploitation film but was actually sponsored by the U.S. Government - a convincing lie, but a lie nonetheless. That being said, the film is still quick enjoyable since it dramatizes the \"violent narcotic's ... soul destroying\" effects on unwary teens, and their hedonistic exploits enroute to the bottom.

After they finished making \"The Flying Deuces,\" they returned to Hal Roach Studios to make films. In order to make this movie, producer Boris Morros bought the rights to the 1931 French film \"Les deux legionnaires,\" which had a similar plot. \"The Flying Deuces\" was Morros' first independent production and it was shot in continuity over a span of four weeks. Only one day was reportedly needed for retakes. The French original starred Fernandel and Noel Noel. SYNOPSIS: Ollie is in love with a woman. When he find out that she is already married, he tries to kill himself. Of course, the suicide is prevented and the boys join the Foreign Legion to get away from their troubles. Eventually, they are arrested for trying to desert the Legion and escape the firing squad by stealing a plane."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":83,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933.ogv","title":"The Ghoul","description":"The Ghoul is a 1933 British Horror film starring Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, Ernest Thesiger and Ralph Richardson, whose debut film this was. The plot centres around a Professor (Karloff) who is to be buried with an Egyptian jewel in order to attain eternal life. When the jewel is stolen by his servant, the professor rises from the dead to reclaim it. The film, based on the play and novel by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, was once considered to be a lost film since the original nitrate negative had succumbed to decomposition and no prints of the film were known to exist.

You see her Mum has cut her wrists after a long unrewarding career as the town mattress. Fortunately for Luci, her Mum's childhood friend is now a very successful upper-middle class doctor who has decided to take Luci home to his family (on a trial basis). Luci's new family (The Quayles) has a few issues. The father's libedo is on the wane and he has a stick permanently stuck up his butt. The mother was \"convent schooled\" and misses the good old days of snuggling up with a pretty young girl. The son is an amateur peeper without the libedo problem but also with a stick up his butt. Luci arrives in the midst of all this with her one suitcase, a bit unbalanced from her mother's recent suicide, and does everything she can to fit in with her new family - more or less. There isn't a whole lot of nudity or explicit sex. I've read that the film was originally given an \"X\" rating but don't let that fool you. This was 1968. Many films which would barely make an \"R\" rating today got an X in those days. In any event, it was released on video in the 1980s with an \"R\" rating and the copyright was abandoned in the U.S. in the mid 1990's. The video is \"Deleted\" in England. This is probably as \"uncut\" a version as one is likely to find. According to IMDB it is 3 minutes longer than the theatrical release and a couple of minutes shorter than the Brazilian release.

But he also had a brief Hollywood heyday during the mid 1940s, when he made some of his best films. Scarlet Street has been claimed by film noir. This attribution is understandable. The lighting is dark, with heavy use of shadows. The characters are all shady as well. Kitty is certainly a femme fatale, although hints are dropped that she is an inherently decent person who has become completely corrupted by Johnny. Being the most naive, Robinson is also the most sympathetic. But even he eventually turns to crime to fulfill his passions. But while Scarlet Street has elements of film noir, it is in reality a black comedy. While Robinson plays it straight throughout, Bennett and Duryea camp it up marvelously. Bennett laughs when Robinson claims to be a painter: \"And here I had you pegged as a cashier!\" She also has to suppress laughter when Robinson reveals that he is married, and shock when Duryea passes her off as the mysterious painter."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":70,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/last_woman_on_earth1960/last_woman_on_earth1960_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/last_woman_on_earth1960/last_woman_on_earth1960.ogv","title":"Last Woman On Earth","description":"You can find more information regarding this film on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054017/\" rel=\"nofollow\">its IMDb page</a>."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":83,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/Hemp_for_victory_1942/Hemp_for_victory_1942_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/Hemp_for_victory_1942/Hemp_for_victory_1942.ogv","title":"Hemp for Victory","description":"US government propaganda film made during WWII touting the virtues of hemp.

Elmo Lincoln was perhaps the best actor at the time for the role. It's a fairly straight forward telling of the novel, tho Edgar Rice Burroughs was frequently on the set in an advisory role and his input was seldom utilized. In the books, Tarzan was quite the self-made scholar and this was barely touched upon in the film. For 1918, this turned out to be an excellent film, parts of which still hold up today.

A narrator told the story of the 10 crewmen as examples of simple average American boys doing a tough job. The men and plane were filmed during the bombing raid on the submarine plens in Wilhelmshafen, Germany, \"just one mission of just one plane and one crew in one squadron in one group of one wing of one Air Force out of fifteen United States Army Air Forces.\" It used handheld 16mm and 35mm cameras inside the plane to give the perspective of the crew. Wyler in fact combined footage from several missions to represent this last 25th mission of the plane, a mission that was actually a milk run with no casualties and no difficult landing. He also used film shot by the 8th AAF Combat Camera Unit. Wyler wanted to film a flak burst but never was able to get one: \"I could never get one explosion because how the hell do you know where one's going to explode? Once the cloud is there it's too late. All that flak so close to us, and I could never get the explosion.\" From October 1943 to March 1944, Wyler edited in the U.S. the 20,000 feet of film he shot in Europe, producing a 42-minute color film that was considered beautiful and dramatic."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":77,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/CHILD/CHILD_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/CHILD/CHILD.ogv","title":"The Child Molester (1964)","description":"Produced by the Highway Safety Foundation in 1964, this shocking film deals with a subject quite taboo for its time.

Many reviewers and film historians consider it the greatest film of the silent era. The mammoth film was also subtitled: \"A Sun-Play of the Ages\" and \"Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages.\" Griffith was inspired to make this film after watching the revolutionary Italian silent film epic Cabiria (1914) by director Giovanni Pastrone. Intolerance was a colossal undertaking filled with monumental sets, lavish period costumes, and more than 3,000 extras. The film consisted of four distinct but parallel stories that demonstrated mankind's intolerance during four different ages in world history."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":89,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/salt_of_the_earth/salt_of_the_earth_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/salt_of_the_earth/salt_of_the_earth.ogv","title":"Salt Of The Earth","description":"Tells the tale of a real life strike by Mexican-American miners. The story is set in a remote New Mexico town where the workers live in a company town in company owned shacks without basic plumbing. Put at risk by cost cutting bosses, the miners strike for safe working conditions. As the strike progresses the issues at stake grow beyond that, driven by the workers' wives. At first the wives are patronized by the traditional patriarchical culture, however they assert themselves as equals and an integral part of the struggle, calling for improved sanitation and dignified treatment. Ultimately, when the bosses win a court order against the workers preventing them from demonstrating gender roles reverse with the wives taking over the picket line and preventing scab workers from being brought in while the husbands stay at home and take care of house and children. This film was selected for the National Film Registry in 1992 by the Library of Congress. It became public domain after its copyright was not renewed in 1982. \"Salt of the Earth\" was produced, written and directed by victims of the Hollywood blacklist. Unable to make films in Hollywood they looked for worthy social issues to put on screen independently. This film never would have been made in Hollywood at the time, so it is ironic that it was the anti-communist backlash that brought about the conditions for it to be made. In many ways it was a film ahead of its time, mainstream culture did not pick up on its civil rights and feminist themes for at least a decade.

It was partly based on the 1902 stage musical, though much of the film deals with the Wicked Witch of the West, who does not appear in the musical."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":85,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/Bluebeard/Bluebeard_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/Bluebeard/Bluebeard.ogv","title":"Bluebeard","description":"Young female models are being strangled inexplicably.

It should be noted that serials were nothing new at this point in time. Formative efforts such as THE PERILS OF PAULINE had already established the appeal of these generally inexpensive actioners, with their bizarre twists and inventive death traps. The emphasis was generally on a resourceful protagonist pitted against an equally inventive and determined fiend -- frequently an unsuspected heir or lawyer out to obtain an undeserved inheritance. LES VAMPIRES did this formula one better, making the menace a vast and largely unsuspected criminal empire which is devouring Paris from inside. With members taken from all classes, the dark society is able to plunder, blackmail and murder without dear of action from the authorities. This continues until their removal of a government investigator brings ambitious reporter Philippe Guerande (Edouard Mathe) into things. Sent to the country to search for details on the official's murder, Philippe plans to combine business and pleasure by meeting Dr. Lox, an old family friend who has a chateau in the area. Arriving at Lox's estate at the same time as an American heiress who means to purchase the property, the reporter is promptly framed for theft by the hooded agents of the gang, who are secreted in the ancient building. Locating the dead investigator's head, Philippe manages to turn suspicion on Lox. Murdering the heiress and making his escape across the rooftops, the \"doctor\" is revealed as the Grand Vampire the (evident) leader of the criminal society. Philippe falls into the Vampires' hands but is rescued by Oscar Cloud Mazamette (Marcel Levesque) -- a clerk and minor member of the gang whom he had helped earlier. Philippe and Mazamette combine to try to expose the society's operations and bring the gang to a deserved end. A series of adventures follow, with the Grand Vampire (Fernand Herrmann) and exotic dancer/criminal Irma Vep (Musidora) providing much of the opposition. In a surprise development, it is revealed that the Grand Vampire is not the gang's ultimate leader. When it is convenient, his superior eliminates him. He, in turn, commits suicide when he is imprisoned by the police. Satanas, the criminal mastermind behind the group's poisons and explosives steps in and assumes co-command with Irma Vep. This occurs too late, however, as Philippe is closing in on the gang's chief meeting place. After a series of close calls, the reporter and the reformed Mazamette succeed in destroying the Vampires' leadership and bringing the rank and file members to justice. Not enough emphasis can be placed on the serial's grim and stark look, which almost functions as a characters of its own. This is a Paris where the gang's activities have seemingly terrified the people to the degree that they refuse to venture out unless it is absolutely unavoidable. Production took place during WW I, when the streets were largely abandoned, and this strange desolation combines with the scurrying of the few characters to present a powerful emphasis that goes beyond the actual turns and twists of the plotline. The result is compelling, entertaining, and more than a bit weird in spots. Tinted scenes add to the welcome air of unreality."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":85,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/The_General_Buster_Keaton/The_General_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/The_General_Buster_Keaton/The_General.ogv","title":"The General (complete & clearer)","description":"<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"http://ia311014.us.archive.org/3/items/The_General_Buster_Keaton/_General--front.jpg\" alt=\"_General--front.jpg\" /></p> <table width=\"90%\" cellpadding=\"8\" align=\"center\"><tr bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"><td> <font><b>A great Buster Keaton silent movie.

Mike was the first full-scale hydrogen explosive device to be tested, yet was only a scientific test of a thermofusion implosion device concept. Mike was not a deliverable weapon. The island where the device was detonated was vaporized. The hole Mike left was big enough to accommodate 14 Pentagon-size buildings and deep enough to hold 17 story building under water, in a crater one mile in diameter and approximately 175 feet deep. Mike's yield was an incredible 10.4 megatons, signaling the proof-tested expansion of the nuclear explosive technology concepts from nuclear fission to thermofusion. Thermofusion is the same process that occurs in the core of the Sun. This test, however, was not the first test of a liquid thermonuclear explosive. The first test ever conducted into the fusion principle occurred during Operation GREENHOUSE at Eniwetok in 1951, with the 225 kiloton George test. Another test of hydrogen in the center of a nuclear weapon before Mike was during the GREENHOUSE Item test at Eniwetok, proving a critical stockpiling yield efficiency concept, called \"boosting.\" The detonation of the Mike device was the climax of an intense debate over what would be the nation's correct response to the startling news in 1949 that the Soviet Union had detonated a nuclear weapon. Many wanted the U.S. to develop the means to produce and field a large number of fission bombs of varying yields which could be used for tactical purposes. Others believed that the country should institute a crash program like the Manhattan Project to develop a Super weapon based on the idea of forcing together or fusing light atoms with a fissile device to produce enormous amounts of energy. After a bitter fight among scientific, government and military officials, the President opted for a crash program to demonstrate the Super bomb, now called a hydrogen or thermonuclear weapon. Many designs were evaluated and rejected until the Mike proposal came along. This concept involved the cooling of hydrogen fuel to a liquid form, near absolute zero, and fusing the hydrogen nuclei into helium using a nuclear fission bomb as a trigger. The Mike device was a 22-foot-long, 5-foot-diameter cylinder housing canisters of liquid hydrogen fuel. These liquid fuel canisters were heavily encased with the nuclear fission explosive trigger. The Mike shot occurred on October 31, 1952, as scientists watched from 40 miles away as the mushroom cloud rose into the stratosphere. Mike was followed on November 15, 1952 by the King shot, the largest all-fission device ever tested by the United States. It was a uranium super oralloy Mark 18 prototype implosion core in a Mark 6D casing, with an advanced warhead that enabled it to produce 500 kilotons of equivalent TNT explosive energy. About the Mike phase narrator: Reed Hadley narrated and hosted this portion. Parallel to his public life as a radio, television, and movie star -- with the credit of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- Reed Hadley worked in a top secret military role as a presenter for Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) films. AFSWP produced films through the United States Air Force Lookout Mountain Laboratory located in Hollywood, California. These AFSWP films covered analysis and documentary archives in nuclear weapons testing, special weapons systems development, as well as Civil Defense films. A key role of the laboratory was to produce films for national defense projects archives, military training films, and documentation for top secret oversight and appropriations committees of United States Congress. About the King phase narrator: Carey Wilson narrated this portion. Wilson was a very influential producer and scriptwriter in Hollywood -- principally with MGM -- and led a double life role as a \"Q-Clearance\" presenter and contributing scriptwriter in top secret films produced by the Atomic Energy Commission and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Q-Clearance was a top secret classification within the Atomic Energy Commission, later renamed to the Department of Energy. Interviewed in this film was the firing team commander, Stanley W. Burriss. He was an engineer by profession. He later became among the greatest forces for creating the U.S. Fleet Ballistic Missile, and later, critical contibutions to generations of Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident weapons systems. He managed this unprecedented scientific, engineering, and command management undertaking, which had profound effects on the civilian space program. Burriss retired as president of Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, after 25 years with Lockheed, and died in the spring of 1979. Captain Jack S. Hartwick, appearing near the beginning of the film in the bridge, was the commander of the USS Estes, host to the Mike device firing control and Joint Task Force 132 operations command center. Major General Percy Clarkson was supreme commander of Joint Task Force 132. Some notes about filming techniques of 1950s color filming: 1950s color film was not capable of satisfactory sensitivity to light in darkness. A workaround was to film during the daylight, using a blue filter. The low sensitivity to blue light -- the most sensitive was yellow -- of the color film made for dark scenes that simulated nighttime or hours of darkness. Notice the bright reflections of ambient light and the tall shadows during the \"hours of darkness\" scenes. This was not the moon creating these shadows. The film's hours of darkness scenes appear very dark in digitized form, played on a personal computer. Burning the DVD file as a data import file (without reencoding in MPEG2!) will have a much brighter picture when played on a home TV or theater system. Comments concerning DOE/DoD film releases in VHS: Disappointment and irritation are the common reactions to the DOE release procedure of transferring their Digital Betacam format masters to VHS. This change in colorspace formats creates very pale, horizontal lines in the picture. The ritual procedure of releasing sanitized and unclassified DOE/DoD films through the Authorized Derivative Declassification (ADD) experts at Kirtland is to edit the transfer of 16 mm celluloid to Digital Betacam master tapes by selectively turning off the capture of audio, video, or both to preserve DOE/DoD secrets. VHS NTSC tape releases are then derived from Digital Betacam tapes.

A poor guy loves a girl but there's another man after her, and her father is also in the way. It starts out like Charlie Chaplin, but it goes on to show the basic moral failures of the Westernized capitalistic city. While it has its problems (one of the biggest being that it has two huge framing devices right at the beginning - it takes a few minutes before it really gets going) I consider this movie on par with \"The Goddess\", and one of the best mainland Chinese movies ever. It's my first time subtitling a Chinese movie, I'd appreciate any feedback. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0;\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/publicdomain/88x31.png\" /></a> <br />This work is dedicated to the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Public Domain</a>."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":70,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/the_shadow_strikes/shadow_strikes_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/the_shadow_strikes/shadow_strikes.ogv","title":"The Shadow Strikes","description":"Film based on the Street and Smith Magazine publication \"The Shadow\""},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":null,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/Battle.of.Midway.1942/Battle.of.Midway.1942_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/Battle.of.Midway.1942/Battle.of.Midway.1942.ogv","title":"The Battle of Midway","description":"The Battle of Midway chronicles a significant moment in U.S. History, as have other Ford films like Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) and My Darling Clementine (1946), but the focus here is on ordinary Americans filmed at the time, not famous historical figures seen in retrospect. Although the use of a hand-held 16mm camera will strike some as uncharacteristic of Ford's style, there are many \u00c2Fordian\u00c2 touches throughout the film.

Everytown is destroyed by air raids (dramatically enacted four years before the real thing).The war continues for thirty years, its original purpose forgotten. As a result, civilization degenerates while \"the Wandering Sickness\" and devastation accelerate the spiral down until 1970, when the world has crumbled into a balkanized \"Mad Max\" Dark Ages.

He'd appear as a mummy, Count Dracula, a deranged hunchback, and his most famous role of Waldemar Daninsky, the doomed werewolf. After directing several successful \"El Hombre Lobo\" romps for Naschy, Le\u00f3n Klimovsky was back on hand for this undead entry, known in Spain as LA REBELION DE LAS MUERTAS. Naschy takes on two roles; an East Indian guru named Krishna and his scarred brother Kantaka, who uses some kind of voodoo to bring back the dead and haunt a redheaded British woman (Romy, who looks great in a pink nightgown) after her father gets the hatchet in the head. Like Klimovsky's DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, some of this film was shot on location in London, the city where it takes place in. Anyone expecting George Romero-inspired antics should look elsewhere. Klimovsky's zombies are mainly female actresses in black cloaks and blue face make-up who stroll around and grin a lot (they look something like the vamps in Andy Milligan's ultra-cheap THE BODY BENEATH). One haunting scene in which they attack a morgue attendant is somewhat reminiscent of Klimovsky's own WEREWOLF'S SHADOW (as well as a scene in the first \"Blind Dead\" film), with the bizarre image of the pasty-faced gals mutilating his neck with the rim a soda can!"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":44,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/DeviloftheDesertAgainstSonofHercules/DeviloftheDesertAgainstSonofHercules_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/DeviloftheDesertAgainstSonofHercules/DeviloftheDesertAgainstSonofHercules.ogv","title":"The Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules","description":"The daughter of a well-off man is sold into slavery, only to be later rescued by the film's hero.

Zeitgeist was created as a not for profit expression to inspire people to start looking at the world from a more critical perspective and to understand that very often things are not what the population at large think they are. The information in Zeitgeist was established over a year long period of research and the current Source page on this site lists the sources used / referenced. Soon, an interactive transcript will be online with detailed footnotes and links. It's important to point out that there is a tendency to simply disbelieve things that are counter to our understanding, without the necessary research performed. For example, some information contained in Part 1 and Part 3, specifically, is not obtained by simple keyword searches on the Internet. You have to dig deeper. For instance, very often people who look up \"Horus\" or \"The Federal Reserve\" on the Internet draw their conclusions from very general or biased sources. Online encyclopedias or text book Encyclopedias often do not contain the information contained in Zeitgeist. However, if one takes the time to read the sources provided, they will find that what is being presented is based on documented evidence. Any corrections, clarifications & further points regarding the film are found on the Clarifications page. Downloadable formats are also now available.

P\u00e1l commissioned the script by James O'Hanlon and Rip Van Ronkel. The film was directed by Irving Pichel, was shot in Technicolor and was distributed in the USA by Eagle-Lion Classics. Four American astronauts blast off from the New Mexico desert and fly to the Moon. They land after difficulties that cause more fuel to be used than anticipated. Consequently, the crew must race against time to lighten the ship for a successful return to Earth. The film features the premise that US private industry will finance and manufacture the first spacecraft to reach the moon, given the Soviet threat at the time, and then the US government will bring itself to buy or lease the technology. Visionary industrialists are shown cooperating to support the venture. Destination Moon was the first major science-fiction film dealing seriously with the prospect, problems and technology of space travel produced in the United States, and won the Academy Award for Visual Effects in the name of the effects director, (Lee Zavitz). The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Ernst Fegte, George Sawley)[1]. The eminent science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein contributed significantly to the script and served as a technical advisor. Heinlein also published, about the same time as the release of the film, \"Destination Moon.\" a novella of the same name that was based on the screenplay. The film was promoted through an unprecedented onslaught of publicity in the print media. Seven years before Sputnik, the movie clearly spells out a rationale for the space race: unnamed enemies (clearly understood at the time to be the Soviets) are sabotaging the American space program, and unless the West beats them to the moon, they will establish a strategic advantage to conquer the world. Destination Moon includes an animated segment of Woody Woodpecker illustrating the basics of space flight. The segment serves to educate not only certain characters in the story, but the audience as well. As a narrative device, this technique has been employed in subsequent films, such as Jurassic Park. The film shows the rocket being constructed in situ in the desert, and Lockheed aircraft plant in Southern California is shown with workers examining a model of the nuclear spacecraft. Transitional sequences show Lockheed Constellations being assembled. The fictional rocket uses nuclear thermal propulsion, a method that has not been employed in actual rocket launches to date. This movie was not the first such to hit the screens, however; Rocketship X-M stole its thunder. The sets and costumes were re-used in films subsequently, and even appear in the second episode of The Time Tunnel. Both Destination Moon and Rocketship X-M contain a polemical element, but with almost diametrically opposed messages: where Rocketship X-M contains a seriously intended anti-nuclear message, Destination Moon has a nuclear-powered spacecraft taking off in defiance of a court order, and depicts the court order as inspired by irrational fear. Once on the moon, the crew find evidence that the moon is a source of uranium. A relationship between the film and Heinlein's novel Rocket Ship Galileo exists. In the novel, the astronauts are high school boys led by an older scientist, the enemies are the Nazis rather than the Soviets, and the emphasis is on conflict with them. In the movie, sabotage is only vaguely hinted at, the concept of a space race is introduced, the voyage is a massive industrial undertaking, and the plot revolves around the dangers of the voyage. A common element in both stories is that the rocket takes off in defiance of a court order. The movie is in fact more similar to Heinlein's novella The Man Who Sold the Moon, which according to its copyright date was written by 1949, although it was not published until 1951, the year after Destination Moon premiered. The matte and scene paintings for 'Destination Moon were created by the famous astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell. P\u00e1l also employed Bonestell for work on When Worlds Collide from the novel by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer; The Conquest of Space, which in turn was based on the book by Willy Ley and Bonestell; and The War of the Worlds, notably the opening"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":null,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/x_marks_the_spot_1942/x_marks_the_spot_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/x_marks_the_spot_1942/x_marks_the_spot.ogv","title":"X Marks The Spot","description":null},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":73,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/desert_escape/desert_escape_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/desert_escape/desert_escape.ogv","title":"Desert Escape","description":"Also known as \"Marked Men\" You can find more information regarding this film on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032763\" rel=\"nofollow\">its IMDb page</a>."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":70,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/Reign_of_Terror_movie/Reign_of_Terror_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/Reign_of_Terror_movie/Reign_of_Terror.ogv","title":"Reign of Terror","description":"Also known as \"The Black Book\".

The film opens with an African American minister in church telling his flock why they should join the armed forces to fight the Nazis.

The balance of the film deals with the African American experience within the present war effort, the conditions of their living and training, with special attention paid to the respect and dignity they will have. The quality of the original film is very good, however there are a few \"issues\" apparent in this copy, which was made from a video in the National Achives' collection: - the original work was made up of 5 seperate film reels, there are some noticable breaks in continuity when the reels switch - the framing of the film to video transfer was a bit off, so there is a border visible throughout - there is occassional video dropout, probably due either to the age of the video tape at the National Archives NAIL Control Number: NWDNM(m)-111-M-6022 ARC Identifier: 35956"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":90,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/LoveAffair/LoveAffair_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/LoveAffair/LoveAffair.ogv","title":"Love Affair","description":"Directed by Leo McCarey, this 1939 romantic classic is the first and best version of the old warhorse of a fateful shipboard romance between an aimless playboy and a nightclub singer, both engaged but appearing to be destined to reunite on the top floor of the Empire State Building.

The courageous financiers of this project were the author Upton Sinclair, his wife Mary Craig and a small group of their friends. They had great difficulties in keeping the production going; the economic crisis forced Sinclair to call a halt to it in early 1932. Shooting was stopped with most of the work completed; only one episode could not be filmed. At the same time Josef Stalin insisted on Eisenstein's return to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein left Mexico with Sinclair's promise in mind; that all the negatives would be send to him to enable the final editing of the film in Moscow. Sinclair tried several times in vain to transfer the film footage to Russia, but the Soviet Film Industry was instructed not to import the film. Eisenstein had been denounced both as a political renegade and as a Trotskyite, which was, in the eyes of Stalin, a serious offence. Preventing Eisenstein from finishing his Mexican film was Stalin's punishment. Consequently Eisenstein was left without film work for several years and started teaching at the State Film School. The Stalinist propaganda, which heaped all the blame on Upton Sinclair for the tragic end of \u00a1Que viva M\u00e9xico!, prevailed. Two films utilizing Eisenstein's film footage were made with Upton Sinclair's permission: Thunder over Mexico made in 1933 by Sol Lesser and Time in the Sun, made by Mary Seton in 1939/40. Thanks to the foresight of Sinclair, who in the 1950s deposited the unedited materials of Eisenstein's film with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the subsequent work of Jay Leyda to make them accessible, all is not lost. We are sure that seventy years of archival care and investment in preserving the essence of this film will eventually result in an authentic reconstruction of this lost film. Many film-historians are convinced that \u00a1Que viva M\u00e9xico! is one of Eisenstein's greatest films. \u00a1Que viva M\u00e9xico! stood at the crossroads of Eisenstein\u2019s artistic development and at a crucial point in the evolution of the art of the cinema. This work deserves more than any other to be taken out of the archives, to be appreciated by a new generation! It is a treasure waiting to be discovered."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":80,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/the_law_rides/the_law_rides_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/the_law_rides/the_law_rides.ogv","title":"Law Rides, The","description":"You can find more information regarding this film on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">its IMDb page</a>."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":40,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/wrong_road/wrong_road_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/wrong_road/wrong_road.ogv","title":"Wrong Road","description":"Spoiled young lovers rob bank and hide the loot.

He was at one of the best moments of his career when this spoof about the detective movie genre went into production. \"My Favorite Brunette\" was directed by Elliott Nugent with a style that made it fun and light to watch. The screen play by Edmund Beloin and Jack Rose parodies those films that showed a charismatic private eye get into all kinds of dangerous situations. In this film, Ronnie Jackson, a photographer in San Francisco is suddenly, thrown into a web of intrigue when he steps into the office of his neighbor, the real P.I, Sam McCloud, who is fed up with the job and is leaving town. Enter the femme fatale, something that is a must in this type of film, Carlotta Montay. She will get Ronnie into all kinds of difficult situations and even the gas chamber as he tries his best to deal with all the bad people that are chasing Carlotta. Bob Hope was excellent in his take of Ronnie Jackson. Dorothy Lamour, in all her beauty, made the most of her Carlotta. Two cameos in the film were notorious because they are uncredited and unexpected: Alan Ladd, and Bing Crosby. Others in the film are Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Dingle, Frank Puglia, Reginald Denny, among the supporting cast. The film is still a lot of fun as it makes fun of other more dramatic movies thanks to the direction of Elliott Nugent."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":80,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/TheOver-the-HillGangRidesAgain/TheOver-the-HillGangRidesAgain_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/TheOver-the-HillGangRidesAgain/TheOver-the-HillGangRidesAgain.ogv","title":"The Over-the-Hill Gang Rides Again","description":"The old-time comrades-in-arms join forces to sober up an old buddy, a down-and-out drunk, and restore his reputation.

Set in 1612 and actually based on real events. If this Musical Drama is not put on the internet achieve it will be lost for all time. In the shadow of Pendlehill A music Drama The Pendle witch trials of 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history, and some of the best recorded of the 17th century. The twelve accused lived in the area around Pendle Hill in Lancashire, and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft. All but two were tried at Lancaster Assizes 17\u00e219 August 1612 along with the Samlesbury witches and others, in what became known as the Lancashire witch trials. One was tried at York Assizes on 27 July 1612, and another died in prison. Of the eleven individuals who went to trial \u00e2 nine women and two men \u00e2 ten were found guilty and executed by hanging and one was found not guilty. The Lancashire witch trials were unusual for England at that time in two respects: the official publication of the trial proceedings by the clerk to the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, and in the number of witches hanged together: ten at Lancaster and one at York. It has been estimated that in all of the English witch trials between the early-15th and early-18th centuries, fewer than 500 witches were executed, so this one series of trials over three days in the summer of 1612 accounts for more than 2% of that total. Six of the Pendle witches came from one of two families, each headed by a female in her eighties at the time of the trials: Elizabeth Southerns (aka Demdike), her daughter Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (aka Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Gray, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, trying to make a living from healing, begging and extortion.

It was originally presented in America by World Entertainment Corp. and Harris Associates, Inc. who re-named the film Gammera the Invincible. All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible's American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman. The film opens with Gamera's awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars. The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":80,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/PublicDomainJackandtheBeanstalk/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/PublicDomainJackandtheBeanstalk/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk.ogv","title":"Jack and the Beanstalk","description":"Abbot and Costello musical, based on the fairytale You can read more about this movie on it's <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0044762/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDB page</a>"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":0,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/His_Maj_Scarecrow_OZ/HisMajestyTheScarecrowOfOz_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/His_Maj_Scarecrow_OZ/HisMajestyTheScarecrowOfOz.ogv","title":"His Majesty The Scarecrow of Oz","description":"Classic entry into L Frank Baum's silent Wizard of Oz Series.

There have been a few documentaries by 'old media' crews who don't understand the net and see peer-to-peer organisation as a threat to their livelihoods. They have no reason to represent the filesharing movement positively, and no capacity to represent it lucidly. We wanted to make a film that would explore this huge popular movement in a way that excited us, engaged us, and most importantly, focussed on what we know to be the positive and optimistic vision many filesharers and artists (they are often one) have for the future of creativity. Hopefully you'll enjoy the first part of STEAL THIS FILM ('Stockholm, Summer 2006'). It achieves some, but by no means all, of our goals. To continue we need your help. This film is free for you to share, watch on your DVD player or on your iPod, or show in cinemas. But if you like the work we've done and want us to carry on, use our donate link to send us a couple of dollars or euros. We will start making the second part straight away, and release it on www.stealthisfilm.com and on major BitTorrent trackers, when it's done. Each part, we estimate, will take about 2 months to complete. The plan for the second part is on this wiki. Feel free to add suggestions.

The story is partly based on two Conan Doyle short stories: \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Empty House\". Sceptical about the potential success of the film, the producers sold the rights to the film to \"First Division Pictures\" for 800 pounds. The film was released in July 1931 under the title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\". It was very successful, running for over a month on Broadway, which was unprecidented for a British produced programmer. Reviews hailed the film for \"bringing the real Sherlock Holmes to the screen.\" This prompted 4 more movies in the series The Missing Rembrandt (still considered lost), <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Sign_OF_Four\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sign of Four</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Triumph_of_Sherlock_Holmes\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Murder_At_The_Baskervilles\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles</a>. This film was deemed lost when the only known print (a 16 mm reduction print of the US version) went missing after being shown at a Sherlock Holmes Society reception for Arthur Wontner in 1955.

But the court of public opinion is still against him, and the medical board is meeting to decide whether or not to take his medical license away from him. Before they do, Cromwell, an amateur pilot, decides to join his friend, WWI Ace Donald Evans, on a flight to Alaska looking for a shorter route to Japan by following the Aleutian Islands. They crash in Alaska and Evans is killed, but Cromwell is rescued by a fur trapper named Tom Ross. He takes Cromwell to Armstrong's Trading Post, where is is nursed back to health by Klondike, a girl who works for Armstrong, and was engaged to marry Armstrong's son Jim. The latter is suffering from the same disease that Cromwell's last patient had. Mark talks Cromwell into performing the same operation again and, this time, it is a success.

As he matures, Faversham (John Clements) falls deeply in love with Ethne Burroughs (June Dupr\u00e9z) and decides that he would rather spend his life in his own way than be trapped in the futile repetitiveness that is a soldier family. On the eve of his unit's embarkation to a mission against Egyptian rebels, he resigns his commission and is branded a coward -- one of the worst labels in Victorian England -- by both his friends and his betrothed. To reclaim his honor and prove both to himself and others that he is not a coward, Faversham sails to darkest Africa and return the 'feathers' of cowardice sent to him by his former comrades by freeing them."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":93,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/cowboy_counsellor/cowboy_counsellor_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/cowboy_counsellor/cowboy_counsellor.ogv","title":"Cowboy Counsellor","description":"A con man posing as a lawyer winds up defending a man falsely accused of robbery.

This is, to some extent, understandable; I myself admit to a slight preference for the latter movie, and the blaxploitation angle certainly makes The Thing with Two Heads stand out from the two-headed-guy movie crowd in a way that The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant does not. But there really ought to be room in the hearts and minds of schlock-lovers for both films, and in that light, the eclipse of the earlier flick is unfortunate. For not only is The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant the prototype, it also has an entertainment advantage its younger brother lacks: The Thing with Two Heads has a certain cockeyed logic to it, while the underlying premise of this movie makes no damn sense at all. A short prologue establishes the character of serial rapist-murderer Manuel Cass (Albert Cole, from Angels\u2019 Wild Women and the legendarily bad Al Adamson western The Female Bunch)\u2014 his crimes and his subsequent confinement to a hospital for the criminally insane. Then, we turn our attention to a man who probably isn\u2019t a whole lot less crazy than Cass. Linda Girard (Pat Priest, best known for playing Marilyn on \u201cThe Munsters\u201d) has just about had it with her husband, Dr. Roger Girard (Bruce Dern, from Silent Running and The Trip). Ever since he was drummed out of the hospital where he worked over some unexplained controversy regarding his private line of medical research, Roger has scarcely left the windowless confines of his basement laboratory, where he toils day and night with his assistant, Max (Barry Kroeger, of Nightmare in Wax and The Time Travelers), on some secret project or other. When the Girards\u2019 friend, Dr. Ken Anderson (Casey Kasem, from The Dark and The Cycle Savages), drops by for a visit, Linda tells him she\u2019s strongly considering leaving her reclusive, obsessed husband. She still loves the man, but she\u2019s sick of trying to compete for his attention with his mysterious research. When Anderson offers to talk to Roger about Linda\u2019s dissatisfaction, she thinks that would be a wonderful idea, and she immediately shows him downstairs to the lab. Once we (and Anderson) get a look inside, it becomes instantly comprehensible why Girard has been so hush-hush about everything. Girard\u2019s lab is full of animals with two heads. Two-headed monkeys, two-headed rabbits, two-headed dogs\u2014 even a two-headed snake. Why? I don\u2019t really know; Girard spends most of the next scene explaining it, but it didn\u2019t make any sense to me. (I do know\u2014 or at least strongly suspect\u2014 that this scene was the inspiration for the mad scientist on \u201cSouth Park\u201d with all his four-assed critters.) In any event, Anderson gives his friend the heads-up that his wife might very well skip out on him if he doesn\u2019t get out of the lab and start spending some time with her, and after getting Roger\u2019s word that he\u2019ll try to do better by Linda in the future, he heads off to work\u2014 at the very hospital from which Girard had been fired, incidentally. Meanwhile, we meet the other two members of the Girard household, caretaker Andrew Norton (Larry Vincent, from The Witchmaker and Dr. Death: Stealer of Souls) and his gigantic, retarded son, Danny (John Bloom, who played monsters for Al Adamson in Brain of Blood and Dracula vs. Frankenstein). When Girard was giving Anderson his nonsensical spiel about the purpose of his work, he said something about people with irreparable brain damage, so once we hear that Danny\u2019s retardation stems from an incident in his childhood, when he was trapped by a cave-in in an abandoned mineshaft for long enough for his brain to be wrecked by oxygen starvation, it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that Danny is going to end up with somebody else\u2019s head grafted onto his shoulder before this movie is through. And if you\u2019ve guessed that that extra head is going to come from Manuel Cass, give yourself a gold star for the day. Cass breaks out of the asylum, steals a car, and drives out into the California countryside, down a road that will ultimately take him right to the Girard place. Max is in town for some reason, and Roger is predictably down in his lab, so when Cass arrives at the house, Linda is forced at first to confront him alone. When Roger and Andrew try to come to Linda\u2019s rescue, Cass makes short work of them, tying Roger up and murdering Andrew before abducting Linda and driving off with her. Danny comes in soon thereafter, but he proves to be of little use, as he immediately collapses into shock upon seeing his father\u2019s body. Thus, Linda\u2019s rescue will have to wait for Max\u2019s return from town. The two doctors grab a shotgun each, go driving off after Cass\u2019s stolen \u201861 Comet, and eventually corner the psychopath not far from the entrance to the old mine. Roger shoots Cass in the back, then he and Max pack him and Linda up, and return home. The question now is, what to do with Danny? The big man is practically catatonic when the rest of the Girard household gets back, and neither Roger nor Max has much hope of him ever recovering. Now as it happens, Max has been getting itchy to try the head-graft technique out on a human subject\u2014 evidently, this research holds the key to him regaining the full use of his hands, which haven\u2019t worked right in about ten years for reasons that are never explained. Sure, you and I might ask how Max thinks his gimp hands are going to profit from the successful grafting of a second head onto a high-grade moron, but you and I are not accomplished surgeons or medical researchers, and in any event, who the hell would pay good money to see a movie called The Incredible 4-Handed Transplant? Okay\u2014 I would, but still... Max points out that Cass isn\u2019t quite dead yet, and that a catatonic retard and a homicidal maniac are of no real use to society as they are. But if Danny and Cass were used to further medical science for the benefit of all mankind (\u2018cause we all know how much mankind will benefit from having a bunch of two-headed guys running around), then their lives would finally be given some meaning. Evidently it never occurs to Roger that putting a psycho\u2019s head on a colossal, superhumanly strong body probably isn\u2019t a very good idea, because he sees Max\u2019s point, and the next scene has the two men in the basement, performing the titular transplant. Roger explains Danny\u2019s disappearance to Linda by claiming the distraught man-boy ran away during the night. So do you think Cass is going to be the first of our monster\u2019s two heads to wake up? And do you think he\u2019ll then use Danny\u2019s immense strength to further his interrupted criminal career? Of course you do. And that is indeed exactly what happens. Danny\u2019s feeble will is no match for the murderer\u2019s, and he is forced to stand by as a traumatized spectator to his own killing spree as Cass has him attack Lovers\u2019 Lane, a biker gang\u2019s campsite, and finally the Girard household. Meanwhile, Ken Anderson has become suspicious of Roger\u2019s increasing reclusiveness, especially once he hears that witnesses to the attack on Lovers\u2019 Lane describe the perpetrator as a giant with two heads. Anderson teams up with the Sheriff (Jack Chester, of Die, Sister, Die!), and leads the police to Girard, whom he confronts with the information that the most recent product of his experiments has killed five people, in addition to kidnapping Linda once again. After the cops go off to follow the bloodhounds trailing the monster, Roger, Max, and Ken form their own posse, and head straight for what Roger thinks is the creature\u2019s most likely hideout\u2014 the mine where Danny was trapped as a child. As a special bonus, the climax treats us not only to the expected monster fight, but also to one of the cheapest, most unconvincing cave-ins in cinema history."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":75,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/UncleJoe/Uncle_Joe_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/UncleJoe/Uncle_Joe.ogv","title":"Uncle Joe","description":"A film that's cheap, silly, and short.

This film was originally released on March 18 1910. From the Edison Kinetogram: Frankenstein, a young student, is seen bidding his sweetheart and father goodbye, as he is leaving home to enter a college in order to study the sciences. Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else. His great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it. To Frankenstein's horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room, only to have the misshapen monster peer at him through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him. After a few weeks' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. In other words, the story of the film brings out the fact that the creation of the monster was only possible because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein's coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride's room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein's feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house. When Frankenstein's love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror he see's the image of the monster reflected instead of his own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster's image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein's mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":90,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/cco_herculesandthecaptivewomen/ccoPublicDomainHercules_and_the_Captive_Women_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/cco_herculesandthecaptivewomen/ccoPublicDomainHercules_and_the_Captive_Women.ogv","title":"Hercules and the Captive Women","description":"This movie is not fully uploaded.

The story concerns a real life bushranger (outlaw) named Captain Starlight, who became a national hero (like Ned Kelly). It is based on a classic Australian novel by Rolf Boldrewood (the pen name of Thomas Browne). This was the third film of the novel. The first, directed by Charles McMahon, was an early feature film made shortly after \"The Story of the Kely Gang\". The second was made in 1911. The 1957 Rank Organisation production starring Peter Finch was one of the most popular Australian films of the 1950s. It was again remade as a TV mini-series in 1985 starring Sam Neill. The 1920 version is one of the few surviving independently produced Australian silent films. This version comes from a video tape released by the New South Wales Department of Education, Sydney in 1984. This is from a multi-generational VHS copy. I have put the video through as much video noise reduction as I could without effecting the image. Its not very good quality but this is a decent movie and a valuable artifact.

After 20 years absence, he returns as a middle-aged married man feeling trapped by marriage and tempted to re-visit his old haunts. As it often happens with legends, however, the Don Juan of the past has become far greater and more wonderful in women's minds than he ever was, especially when a young imitator is killed (by a jealous husband) and mistaken for Don Juan. Then a book entitled 'the Private Life of Don Juan' is published and read by swooning women, and the whole thing is reminiscent of our real larger-than-life legends such as Elvis. And as with Elvis, whom we prefer to remember as young, slim and handsome, so Don Juan lives in women's minds so that the real middle-aged Don Juan is treated like a kindly father-figure by young women - much to his dismay!"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":0,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/CURSEOFKINGTUTSTOMB1980TVMOVIEPART1OF2_0/KING_TUT_PT_1_OF_2_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/CURSEOFKINGTUTSTOMB1980TVMOVIEPART1OF2_0/KING_TUT_PT_1_OF_2.ogv","title":"CURSE OF KING TUTS TOMB 1980 TV MOVIE PART 1 OF 2","description":"CURSE OF KING TUT ON THOSE WHO DISTURB HIS RESTING PLACE"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":73,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/BreakfastInHollywood_961/Breakfast_in_Hollywood_1_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/BreakfastInHollywood_961/Breakfast_in_Hollywood_1.ogv","title":"Breakfast in Hollywood","description":"A comedy about many women in Hollywood who try to get noticed at Tom Breneman's popular radio show Breakfast in Hollywood. - Release Date: 02/26/1946 <a href=\"http://mystic-nights.com/videos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystic Nights Videos</a>"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":72,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/ReturnOfTheWhistler/Return_of_the_Whistler_1948_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/ReturnOfTheWhistler/Return_of_the_Whistler_1948.ogv","title":"Return of the Whistler","description":"Based on a Cornell Woolrich story, this is the last of the Whistler movies and the only one that doesn't feature Richard Dix.

Tim Clark John Wayne ... Duke Walter Brennen - Sheriff\u00e2s Deputy Bendix Story by William Colt MacDonald (Creator of The Three Mesqueteers stories) Made by Columbia Studios Written by pulp writer William Colt MacDonald, this Tim McCoy Columbia Studios Western may have been the forerunner of McDonald's later so popular The Three Mesqueteers. John Wayne, whose character is named, appropriately, Duke, and Wallace MacDonald (no relation to William Colt) play McCoy's loyal ranch hands, and although they remain in the background for part of the action, the germ of the triad hero is there. Tim McCoy plays a rancher losing his property to a crooked money-lender turned cattle rustler (Wheeler Oakman). The villain is in league with a sheriff's deputy (Walter Brennan) and together they rob the Wells Fargo. There is a final shootout and the dying deputy confesses to both the Wells Fargo heist and to the fact that Tim's ranch was illegally obtained. John Wayne, who didn't get along with Tim McCoy and had several rows with studio czar Harry Cohn, swore that he would never again work for Columbia, a promise he kept. ========================================================================== For a Free Download of Western Movies starring: Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, John Wayne, Johnny Mack Brown, Bill Steele, Rex Allen, Buster Crabbe, Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard, Tex Ritter, Zane Grey, etc. go to this URL: http://moviesfreedownload.googlepages.com/"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":53,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/Lost_Lonely_and_Vicious_1958/Lost_Lonely_and_Vicious_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/Lost_Lonely_and_Vicious_1958/Lost_Lonely_and_Vicious.ogv","title":"Lost, Lonely, and Vicious","description":"A young man's acting career takes off, but he becomes obsessed with death."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":92,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/Hurricane_at_Pilgrim_Hill/Hurricane_at_Pilgrim_Hill_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/Hurricane_at_Pilgrim_Hill/Hurricane_at_Pilgrim_Hill.ogv","title":"Hurricane at Pilgrim Hill","description":"A Hal Roach comedy."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":null,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/ACryFromTheGrave/ACryFromTheGrave_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/ACryFromTheGrave/ACryFromTheGrave.ogv","title":"A Cry From The Grave","description":"Srebrenica : A Cry From The Grave Birlesmis Milletler (BM) tarafindan g\u00fcvenli b\u00f6lge ilan edilmesine ragmen Bosnali Sirp kuvvetleri 11 Temmuz 1995'te Srebrenika\u2019ya girmis ve 8 binden fazla M\u00fcsl\u00fcman\u2019i katletmisti. 30 binden fazla kisi de b\u00f6lgeden s\u00fcr\u00fclm\u00fcst\u00fc.

A Cry from the Grave tells the story of the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, in which the Bosnian Serb army killed an estimated 7,000 Bosnian Muslims. It follows hour by hour the story of the killings. Through the testimony of survivors and relatives of those who died it explores the pain felt when no one is brought to justice.There are interviews with investigators from the UN-sponsored court at The Hague and from the UN special prosecutor. But the underlying message of the film is bleak indeed \u2013 no matter what is done, it will never be enough. A Cry from the Grave has won numerous prizes.

The information in Zeitgeist was established over a year long period of research and the current Source page on this site lists the basic sources used / referenced and the developing Interactive Transcript includes exact source references and further information. A Q & A page is also being developed. Now, it's important to point out that there is a tendency to simply disbelieve things that are counter to our understanding, without the necessary research performed. For example, some information contained in Part 1 and Part 3, specifically, is not obtained by simple keyword searches on the Internet. You have to dig deeper. For instance, very often people who look up \"Horus\" or \"The Federal Reserve\" on the Internet draw their conclusions from very general or biased sources. Online encyclopedias or text book Encyclopedias often do not contain the information contained in Zeitgeist. However, if one takes the time to read the sources provided, they will find that what is being presented is based on documented evidence. Non-Profit DVDs / Free Video Downloads are available through the Downloads page. On October 2nd 2008 the sequel to Zeitgeist will premiere at the 5th Annual Artivists Film Festival in LA. The film will be presented for free online on Oct. 3rd. This feature length work will address the solutions to the problems presented in the original work. This work is entitled: \"Zeitgeist - Addendum\" That being said, It is my hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth, but find out for themselves, for truth is not told, it is realized.

Curse of the Swamp Creature is a rehash of 1957's Voodoo Woman. A mad scientist works in the middle of the swamp to create a monster that will serve his bidding. The actor playing the scientist is a ham of the highest order, and everyone else (including especially our hero, John Agar) is a block of wood. Buchanan's signature editing style is in evidence here -- shots cut together that no rational mind can possibly connect to each other in either space or time, presented as \"different angles\" of the same scene.

This spot slowly enlarges and is focused into shape, until, to the amazement of the audience, the face of the great emancipator is clearly shown. President Lincoln's likeness is allowed to remain upon the altar just long enough for recognition, when, in the same mysterious manner that it appeared, it slowly fades and in its place their grows the picture of President Garfield. This in a like manner fades away, and again as out of the dim distance comes the picture of our great martyred President, William McKinley.

This comes from when they were originally intended to be released as a double feature. \"Contrary to popular belief, this film was not directed by Kenneth G. Crane, was not made in 1970, was not produced by Toei Company, and was not titled \"The Double Garden\". It was originally filmed in 1966 as \"Body of the Prey\" and it was produced and directed by Norman Thomson. Thomson was the popular pulp novelist of the Burns Bannion series, which he wrote under his pen name 'Earl Thomson'. The production was assisted by members of the United States military bases in Japan and shot on location there. During production, Al Rickett wrote about the making of this film in the 'Stars & Stripes' newspaper, as well as having a small part as a gas station owner. However, while Edward D. Wood Jr. claimed he wrote the script for this film under the title \"Venus Flytrap\" and placed it on his resumes, reports of the making of the film in 'Stars & Stripes' claim Thomson wrote the script. It's possible that Wood sold the script to Thomson and it was slightly re-written before production. It's undetermined if the completed film was released theatrically, in either Japan or the United States.\" I have taken the liberty of replacing the credits with the data listed on the IMDb, footage from the Moody Institute's \"Carnivorous Plants,\" and a little music from \"Knife of the Party.\" I did it with my handy-dandy NERO. Since this created a NEW work under the law, despite being a simple combination of Public Domain works, I slapped a copyright notice on the back. Hack those off and the film belongs to everyone. Don't, and you have to let the world know I did the credits. The original VHS release can be downloaded from Public Domain Movie Torrents, complete with incorrect credits under the \"Revenge of Dr. X\" title. Whether or not Ed Wood had anything to do with this steaming dogflop of a film, it's certainly worthy of his name!"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":0,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/queenofsports/queenofsports_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/queenofsports/queenofsports.ogv","title":"Queen of Sports - \u4f53\u80b2\u7687\u540e","description":"A girl comes to Shanghai, where she learns about sports and love.

All of the available copies of this video came from the same deteriorated film. The original film may have been recorded from a collector's copy, or possibly from an old late night movie program. Various vendors have marketed copies all coming from the same source, and possibly from the same VHS copy. At last count there are several vendors, Alpha, Nostalgia Family Video, Anchor Videos, Vci Home Video and others. The older Nostalgia version is available in VHS while the Alpha version is a DVD. The Alpha DVD has slightly better black and white definition which gives the impression of more detail, but it has much much more noise. Both versions have the identical jumps, blackouts during scene changes, and film spots. But the Alpha DVD has enlarged the picture slightly which cuts off important details, and it has cut out parts of several scenes because of bad framing or blank picture. The Nostalgia video is a more complete version and appears to have slightly sharper picture with less noise. The original source was poorly transferred to VHS, or broadcast using old technology. In particular the video was poorly copied and the technician did not pay attention to the framing. The copy available here has been carefully transferred from a fairly complete VHS version. Using VirtualDub the video was stabilized and a large amount of the obtrusive noise was removed. The audio was carefully denoised with care taken to preserve the train sound effects. Obtrusive noises due to the deteriorated film were removed by hand. Some video jumps and the scene blackouts were corrected by hand, but some jumps due to missing frames can not be fixed. Blank video was filled in with adjacent frames or reasonable stills captured from adjacent frames. The bad framing was partially fixed, but could not be completely fixed with the available technology. A more carefully transferred version would be welcome. The result is a much more watchable copy of this movie. It may not be considered a \"classic\" film, but it has a number of good actors and is representative of Hollywood films of the mid '30s. It could even classify as an early science fiction because of the futuristic high speed monorail train. While the \u00e2train\u00e2 looked streamlined, the bloated size would cause large wind resistance, and severely limit its speed. Actually it was not really a train because it only had one car, so it might be considered to be a high speed street car. The futuristic interior design later appeared in many other science fiction films. The basic story concerns a tiff between a producer played by Victor Jory and his runaway star actress played by Evelyn Venable. The action mainly takes place on the Streamline Express, a high speed coast to coast monorail. Other stories are intertwined with the main story, and the usual Hollywood happy ending ensues, after some comical and suspenseful scenes.

The Stoning of Soraya M. is a 2008 American drama film adapted from French-Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam\u2019s 1994 book of the same name based on a true story. Film tells the true story of one of the victims of stonings in modern Iran. Soraya M.\u2019s husband Ghorban-Ali was an ambitious man, prone to rage with a lust for power. He wanted a way out of his marriage in order to marry a 14 year old girl but did not want to support two families or return Soraya\u2019s dowry. When Soraya began cooking for a friend\u2019s widowed husband, he found his excuse: abetted by village authorities, he accused his wife of adultery. She was taken away, buried up to her waist, and then stoned to death. Over the past fifteen years more than 1000 women have been stoned to death in Iran. Here is the true and shocking story of one such woman. \u0633\u0646\u06af\u0633\u0627\u0631 \u062b\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u0645. \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0647

It was shot in 1998 and was premiered at the Phoenix Picturehouse in Oxford on 26th November 1999. The film follows Chloe Mason is an up-and-coming conceptual artist whose controversial exhibition The Devils Feast has opened both to rave reviews and condemnation. Her work is sexual, political, provocative and blasphemous - and open to a wide range of interpretations. To some critics, she\u2019s the new Picasso, to others her entire exhibition is a load of meaningless crap. But whether Chloe Mason is any good or not is almost immaterial. The question is: what sort of person produces work like this? Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about Chloe and the series of events that have led up to The Devils Feast. We also meet the characters whose lives interact with Chloe, inspiring her artistic output. There\u2019s her best friend, Janet, a single mother who is constantly searching for the right man in all the wrong places, and Sticks, the idealistic editor of a local anarchist magazine who becomes Chloe\u2019s boyfriend. And then there\u2019s Paul the leader of a mysterious religious cult: just what is he up to? Like the exhibition of the title, The Devils Feast tackles head-on such weighty topics as religion, sex and politics, throwing in drugs and violence for good measure.

An ambitious prosecutor wants publicity. And an outsider - a Northern teacher in a sleepy Southern town - makes a handy defendant, someone the locals will happily convict, innocent or guilty. Based on the infamous Leo Frank case, They Won't Forget is an explosive, acclaimed indictment of bigotry that's rich in deceptive motives, sudden violence and courtroom suspense. The talent is as powerful as the story: Mervyn LeRoy (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang) produced and directed with steady hand and crackling pacing, Robert Rossen (The Hustler) co-wrote the unflinching script, Claude Rains (Casablanca) etches a portrait of the ruthless prosecutor with poison and guile, and in her first credited role, Lana Turner makes the schoolgirl beguiling prey for an unhinged mind.

It is also perhaps the first non-pornographic movie to portray sexual intercourse. It has also been called the first on-screen depiction of a female orgasm. Hitler\u2019s Germany banned the film because Kiesler was Jewish. In the United States Ecstasy was one of the first movies condemned in the United States by the Legion of Decency. Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just gotten married to an older gentleman, but discovers that he is obsessed with order in his life and doesn't have much room for passion. She becomes despondent and leaves him, returning to her father's house. One day while bathing in the lake she meets a young man and they fall in love.

The Holodomor (Ukrainian: \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440; translation: murder by hunger) was a famine in the Ukrainian SSR from 1932\u20131933, during which millions of inhabitants died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine. Estimates on the total number of casualties within Soviet Ukraine range mostly from 2.6 million to 10 million. Primarily as a result of the economic and trade policies instituted by Joseph Stalin, millions of Ukrainians starved to death over the course of a single year. The causes of the famine are a controversial issue and scholars disagree on the relative importance of natural factors, bad economic policies or engineered measures towards Ukrainian peasants.

I presented the working print version of the film as my final with the intentions of going back to finish the film so I could put the final version up which has become this. This is a documentary film that deals with the issue of censorship. It takes an anti-censorship stance against censorship and is filled with a healthy base of opinions including facts on the subject matter and arguments. This film can also be considered as a drama/comedy as it is serious in its arguments and opinions, but takes a humorous approach to the subject at hand as well. The film tackles multiple issues within the broad subject of censorship which include the opinion of censorship, the right to think for ones self, the MPAA, regulation, fear, responsibility, violence in media, and education to name a few. It does not completely seal the deal for each subject, but does take a look in to each subject for a fair amount of time.

The story is partly based on two Conan Doyle short stories: \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Empty House\". Sceptical about the potential success of the film, the producers sold the rights to the film to \"First Division Pictures\" for 800 pounds. The film was released in July 1931 under the title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\". It was very successful, running for over a month on Broadway, which was unprecidented for a British produced programmer. Reviews hailed the film for \"bringing the real Sherlock Holmes to the screen.\" This prompted 4 more movies in the series The Missing Rembrandt (still considered lost), <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Sign_OF_Four\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sign of Four</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Triumph_of_Sherlock_Holmes\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Murder_At_The_Baskervilles\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles</a>. This film was deemed lost when the only known print (a 16 mm reduction print of the US version) went missing after being shown at a Sherlock Holmes Society reception for Arthur Wontner in 1955. The version presented here is pieced together from two separate prints to create the longest and best quality version of the film. There are noticable differences between the two prints. The lesser quality print is only used to fill in minor sections that were missing or incomplete in the better quality version. It has the US title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\" on screen. The quality is still not optimal, but it is a major improvement from the versions previously available."},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":null,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/ReciprocalCourse/otvetn_hod_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/ReciprocalCourse/otvetn_hod.ogv","title":"Reciprocal course","description":"Reciprocal course"},{"thumbnail":"FIXME JRO","external_rating":null,"mp4":"http://www.archive.org/download/LadyWindermeresFan/LadyWindermeresFan_512kb.mp4","ogg":"http://www.archive.org/download/LadyWindermeresFan/LadyWindermeresFan.ogv","title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","description":"Mrs Erlynne (Irene Rich), the mother of Lady Windermere (May McAvoy) - her daughter does not know about her - wants to be introduced in society, so that she can marry Lord Augustus Lorton (Edward Martindel).
