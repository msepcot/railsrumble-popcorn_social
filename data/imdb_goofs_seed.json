These pistols have a cocking pin indicator, as well as a round indicator on the top of the slide. In this scene the round indicator is down, meaning there is no round in the chamber. Chelios does a brass check after disarming the man, and does not rack a round in the chamber. In the following scene he shots two men with this weapon without a round chambered.","Miscellaneous: When Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is fleeing the triad hospital at the beginning of the movie, he passes a larger-than-life portrait of Mao Zedong. This is highly unlikely, as the Communist Party in China targeted triads during the Chinese Revolution, effectively forcing them out of Mainland China. The government currently maintains very strict anti-triad laws. It is unlikely the triads would lionize Mao.","Factual errors: When the LAPD shock Chev Chelios with a TASER outside the strip club, they appear to are using the wrong model TASER.

However, the angle of the clip was as if the camera was right on the track with them.","Revealing mistakes: When Chelios and Eve fall to the racetrack, they would have been right beside the bleachers.

Although Arthur drinks from it once more and puts it down, it never appears in the saucer again.","Continuity: When Arthur goes back to his house, he makes a cup of tea. When he drinks it, there is clearly milk in it, although he never put any in. When it vibrates along the table, it is black again.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Ford is running to rescue Arthur and the gang as they are being shot at outside Humma Kavula's temple, Ford starts running to the rescue and is supposedly screaming but his mouth is clearly closed.","Continuity: When Ford is scooting along with the trolley full of beer he passes a red truck on the right side of the screen (Ford's left side) however when the shot pans out there are only red trucks on the left side of the screen (Ford's right).","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Arthur is speaking to Trillian (Zooey Deschanel [/name/nm0221046/]) as she takes a shower, he briefly begins to address her by her real name (Zooey), then corrects himself.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Arthur hands in the release form to release Trillian, the Vogon lady tells him it is not a presidential release form, \"Those are blue\". Although Arthur clearly grabbed and handed in a blue form.","Factual errors: When Ford and Arthur are launched into space the narrator falsely states that you can survive in the vacuum of space for 30 seconds by holding your breath. However holding your breath is the last thing you would want to do in space as you would be susceptible to explosive decompression. In actuality you would have a greater chance of surviving by expelling all of the air out of your lungs.","Revealing mistakes: In a shot not long after Humma Kavula removes his glasses revealing only scars underneath, the corners of actual eyes are visible underneath the lenses.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: As the sperm whale is falling through the Magrathean atmosphere, the sound of a humpback whale is heard.

As the camera change to Arthur and then back to the mice on top of the extractor the apple rotates. As the camera snap to a wider view and the saw blades extend the apple falls off but has been rotated again.","Factual errors: In the scene where Marvin and Arthur are sitting by the inter-dimensional portals, Marvin mentions he is a \"manically depressed robot.\" This not technically correct, as manic depression - aka bipolar disorder - is characterized by two extremes in behavior: sadness, lethargy, hopelessness, etc. (what Marvin displays); and mania - which is usually excessive activity (doing a lot of things at once) and sometimes happiness.

In the close-up, her nails are painted teal, but in the next shot and all through camp, Annie has unpainted fingernails.","Continuity: Near the pool, when Annie and Hallie confront their parents and Meredith, Meredith's initial reaction is quickly looking at the twins standing on either side of her. While she looks directly at one, she looks way above the other one's head.","Continuity: Hallie exits the cabin with her locket under her sweatshirt (interior shot), the locket is outside her sweatshirt as she emerges from the cabin (exterior shot), and is back under when she turns around to speak to Annie.","Continuity: In the bar at the hotel, when Elizabeth and Meredith have just met, the camera moves from behind Elizabeth to behind Meredith, and the drink in Elizabeth's hand jumps from her hand to the bar.","Crew or equipment visible: At Camp Walden, when the water ballons are falling onto Annie's head, you can see the arm of a crew member pushing the largest balloon to fall over.","Continuity: When Elizabeth emerges from the hotel before Nick falls into the pool, the sky is bright and cloudless.

She moves to the side so she's right under the balloon.","Continuity: When Annie's mother requests something cold for her forehead inside her hotel room, Annie gets a rag, wets it, and wrings it out. When she hands it over to her mother, it is clean, folded, straight, and dry as if it were just ironed.","Miscellaneous: When Annie is dropped off at Camp Walden, she has three suitcases and one carry-on.

The switch to Camp Walden is 11 years, and 9 months later. That would be early October, not the typical June-August summer camp time frame.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the scene when Annie and Hallie fence, they often turn around. This is a red card offense and means that the person who did not turn will get a point and the fencers stop and start again. If the teacher knew the rules for fencing, she would have stopped the match.","Continuity: When Nick is breaking the news to Annie about the upcoming marriage, the hat on the couch next to her moves several times between shots.","Continuity: When Hallie as Annie walks into the house in London for the first time, she clearly turns a knob on the door to walk in.

When he returns the last bottle, there are four bottles in a row without a gap.","Continuity: In the final scene at the hotel, when Hallie and Annie tell their parents they want to go on the camping trip, the one on the left is missing her right earring. It should have been easy for the audience to tell them apart as the twin who had her ears pierced at camp was shown to have sore ears around the earring, notably in the scene where they're on the phone just before Hallie is discovered.","Continuity: At the end of the opening credit sequence (on the QE2), the photographer comes over to take Nick and Liz's picture. In the shot showing the photographer (from behind the couple), there are lit candles clearly between the couple and the photographer. In the picture taken by the photographer, the candles are absent.","Factual errors: After Hallie places a collect call from England to America, Annie picks up the phone after the first ring and is immediately connected with Hallie. The operator should have been on the line to inform Annie that she was receiving a collect call and ask if she would accept the charges.","Continuity: When Elizabeth takes Annie (Hallie) to the studio there are yellow \"No parking\" lines outside in the street, but as the camera looks out of the window at them, they are no longer there.","Continuity: After Nick falls in the pool and discovers the Hallie/Annie switch, he hugs each girl. In the next shot of them, neither is the least bit wet, although their clothes would at least have gotten damp hugging their soaking father.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the scene after Nick falls into the pool, there are several shots of Meredith in which both of her hands are visible but there is no engagement ring, despite the fact that she and Nick are at the hotel to plan their wedding, and she asked Elizabeth to make her wedding dress.","Continuity: When Hallie and Annie are fencing at Camp one of the girls throws the sword behind her onto the bale of straw, but you see it landing behind the bale, followed by a close up of the sword spinning through the air and landing neatly on top of the straw.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: After the family returns from the camping trip, Elizabeth and Nick are talking on the porch.

One of the girls says something, and the other replies but the sound comes from the same source, proving that in that scene the crew used a lookalike (probably a stunt double) and had Lindsey Lohan say both lines.","Continuity: In the beginning of the switch, it begins with Hallie pretending to be Annie. At the end of the scene she says, \"Speaking of dad, I wonder what he is doing right now?\" But, a flight from the east coast to London is about 7 and a half hours, plus the time change in London, assuming it was noon in London it would be, four in the morning in California. In other words, Nick Parker would have picked Annie (pretending to be Hallie) up from the airport the day before.","Continuity: In the cabin at Camp Walden, a water balloon falls onto Annie and makes her soaking wet. However, when we see her only seconds later, she is completely dry.","Revealing mistakes: When Nick and the girls return from the camping trip, they have a brief conversation with Liz and Nick before heading inside. During this conversation, when Nick is viewed on the left hand side of the screen, he is reflected in the glass of the door they are standing in front of. Although one of the twins is standing right next to Nick, we do not see her reflection, only Nick's. Even when she passes in front of the door, her reflection doesn't appear. (This is most likely a result of the camera tricks used to make Lindsay Lohan [/name/nm0517820/] appear as twins.)","Anachronisms: Annie tells Hallie in 1998 that she eats her Oreos with peanut butter, although Oreos were not introduced in Great Britain until 2008.","Continuity: After Nick falls in the pool and then gets out, he meets Liz and they talk. The pool behind Nick (correctly) is ripply. However, in side shots of the two of them, the portion of the pool in the background is completely calm.","Revealing mistakes: The scene where Annie is sitting down about to get her hair cut, she obviously has holes in her earlobes, when in fact Hallie pierces Annie's ears after her haircut.","Continuity: During the bedroom scene, where Hallie (Annie) tells her mother who she is, she is wearing the \"H\" locket - which should be in Napa with Annie pretending to be Hallie.","Revealing mistakes: When Hallie and Annie are fighting either light is on or off in their cabin, there are several light switch displacements.","Continuity: When Annie goes to jump in the lake naked we don't see the bathing suit. In the next shot when she is on the dock, we can see a faint outline of one.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): On the camping trip, when Nick determines that the \"mosquito repellent\" is just sugar and water, he says \"you'll attract every mosquito\". In fact, since mosquitoes drink blood, they would have no interest in sugared water. It would not \"repel\", but it would also not attract mosquitoes.","Factual errors: After the parents get married, it says \"11 years and 9 months later\", and the girls say they will be 12 soon. Even if the parents get pregnant on their wedding night the girls would only be just turning 11 due to the 9 months it would take for them to be born.","Factual errors: No two people, not even twins, have the exact same number and arrangement of freckles on their faces."],"tt0032799":[],"tt0029542":["Continuity: The credits spell \"Cranston\" with a G.

The trip does not fit in with the sequence this scene fits into, in which the sub is on a desperate race against time from Antarctica to Washington, DC to deactivate a doomsday device. It is improbable that the sub would detour to the other side of the world for nostalgic reasons. However, the extended (Japanese) version begins with a flash-forward to Dr. Yoshizumi walking down to Patagonia and his last trip in the Nereid takes the direct route from Palmer Station to Washington, DC.","Plot holes: The chamber where the ARS is located is reached by Yoshizumi and Carter simply blowing two doors open with plastique and climbing down an elevator shaft. A chamber containing a doomsday device probably contains more elaborate security features, such as blast doors.","Plot holes: The ARS (a device that launches many nuclear missiles in retaliation to a strike) is activated by one man pushing a few buttons. Devices that launch nuclear missiles are normally (and believably) portrayed as requiring launch codes, special keys and the authorization of at least two people.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): SPOILER: When Yoshizumi visits the ruins of a church, an internal monologue depicts him \"talking\" to a corpse.

The band never officially went by the name Stiff Kittens; they did allow it to be used on a poster for a show because they didn't have any other name they could use, but the first official name for that particular band was Warsaw.","Anachronisms: When New order is writing Blue Monday (which was first performed November 1982), the synthesizer on the left is an AKAI 7000.

Wilson objected but by this stage it was too late to remove them due to continuity problems.","Factual errors: According to Tony Wilson on the DVD commentary, the scene showing neo-fascists attending a Joy Division concert or them causing a riot, as implied by the film, never occurred.","Factual errors: The film shows Ian Curtis having hanged himself while watching the Werner Herzog [/name/nm0001348/] film \"Stroszek\".

It was actually a performance by the English space rock band Spiritualized. The building was used for two parties after the club officially closed.","Factual errors: In the film Tony Wilson is seen at the funeral of Ian Curtis however in real life he could not attend the funeral as he was given the task of looking after Annik Honore, Ian's lover from Belgium, so that she would not attend the funeral and cause upset.

The substantial Red River forms the boundary between Oklahoma and the parts of Texas (northeast and north-central) in which they were active criminals.

One shot Jensen Ames head lights are out while Machine Gun Joe has-his head lights on and vice versa. also At one shot you see that Machine Gun Joe has one head light out and in another shot he has both head lights on same with Jensen Ames head lights","Continuity: Lists is shown having his left hand stomped on very hard by one of Pachenko's crew members, yet the next day there are no signs of injury.","Factual errors: The twin Gatling guns on Frankenstein's car are more likely 7.62mm and not 30mm as stated in the movie. A 30mm round is 1.18 inches in diameter, much bigger than what is seen being fired.","Continuity: At the end of the second stage fight, when the \"armed trailer truck\" strikes against a death head, the upper section comes off and gets jerked ahead. There is a side view first followed by a front view. The rear part of this upper section seems to go up inexplicably fast, in the front view after considering side view.","Factual errors: At the introduction Coach tells Frank that the back protection plate AKA Tombstone is 6\" thick solid steel. There are 4 plates 1.5\" thick each and about 40\", 50\", 60\" and 70\" by about 48\" tall. That is about 1972 kilogram or 4340 lbs. of steel. That would make the car so back heavy that at the first hitting of any bump the front of the car would go up and make controlling impossible. Besides that it will also be so heavy that the car won't be fit for race.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: The Gatling guns consistently use the sound of a much lower rate of fire machine gun, e.g. M60. The sound would be more like \"Brrrrr\" than \"Da-da-da\".","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the 3rd round, the announcer describes the contest as \"mano y mano\". That means \"hand and hand\". It's an all-too-common mistake, thinking that the real expression (mano a mano) means \"man against man\"; it doesn't. It means \"hand to hand\" combat.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): One of the characters remarks that the .50 caliber bullets will go through the Tombstone in a few seconds. But a .50 caliber round wouldn't even make a dent in 6\" of solid steel.","Continuity: In the \"Stage 2\" race when the Dreadnought hits towards the death trap the guards are falling all over the road, but in the next take when the truck hits the ground all of them have disappeared.","Continuity: In the scene where Joe asks his partner's driver to light his cigar he is lighting up, but in the next take the cigar is not lit.","Revealing mistakes: When Martinez sticks her head through the sunroof during the race, her hair stays in place - not at all affected by the speeding car.","Continuity: In round one when Frankenstein is shoved into something his cars front bumper and a few other parts fall off, but once out of the building its back together.","Continuity: When Jensen first asks lists how many people Frank has killed he says 20, but at the end of stage 2, when it has the lists of the drivers and the ones who are dead, it says Frankenstein only killed 15 and his car is named the monster on that list. While all the other cars have their actually names, Frank's car is a Ford Mustang.","Revealing mistakes: In stage 3, then Frank and Case release the tombstone, its shown to bounce away in the direction opposite from their Mustang. If the tombstone is just released from the Mustang with mechanical latches, it would bounce in the same direction the Mustang for some time due to the momentum it has from being carried on the Mustang. The only way it could instantly change directions is if it was projected with some other force like an explosive charge, but that is obviously not the case as there would definitely be a blast show. If there was a blast powerful enough to launch the tombstone with that great of force, the mustang would have been launched forward quickly as well, but most likely would have exploded since that launching charge would have detonated the unprotected fuel tank.","Factual errors: The front firing weapons fitted to Pachenko's car are WW-II vintage German MG-34 7.92mm machine guns and Russian PPSh-41 7.62mm submachine guns; the former have Gurttrommel 34 drum magazines each containing a 50 round belt, while the latter can take either a 71 round drum magazine, or a 36 round curved stack magazine. That makes them unsuitable for prolonged firing, as they lack sufficient ammunition and their location also makes them impossible to reload during a race. Plus, they wouldn't even make a dent on the \"tombstone\". Also, the flexible navigator operated machine gun on Carson's car is manually charged and fired, so the activation/kill switch mechanism for it would have to block either the charger or the trigger, but no such thing is visible.","Revealing mistakes: During the intro to stage 3, we see the close up of Frank snapping Pachenko's neck then the camera changes to a wide shot of Frank and a dead Pachenko. This is how the audience viewing Death Race saw it, yet since it is included in the preview to stage 3 the in-movie audience sees, they see a close up shot of Frank killing Pachenko, then a wide shot which shows there was no camera in place to take the earlier shot.","Continuity: When Machine Gun Joe slams into Frankenstein's car at the end of the first race, the driver's door is completely wasted, when it cuts away to Jensen inside the car, the door is magically \"fixed\".","Continuity: When Pachenko flips his car after hitting the steel support you can see that the car has 3 Racing tires and 1 regular as well as the rig used to set it up but in the shot after the car returns to 4 racing slicks.","Continuity: Throughout the Stage 2 part of the race, Hennessey is shown to be wearing a black turtle neck and grey jacket. Yet when the dreadnought crashes, the reaction shot of her has her wearing a black jacket over a blue collared shirt.","Anachronisms: In the opening shots of the movie's first race, the front zoomed view of Frankeinstein's car show the machine guns mounted on the driver's side of the vehicle, where as a few frames later when seen from further away, the guns are mounted on the passenger's side.","Continuity: In both instances that the ejector seat was used in the car (The Monster) the roof flies off. In both of the following shots, the roof has reappeared.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: In the opening title cards, the word \"colosseum\" is spelled as \"Coliseum.\" This is an acceptable if uncommon alternate spelling.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When Machine Gun Joe says \"thou shall not kill\" while cutting his own face, his mouth movements suggest he pronounces each word in quick succession. However, the word \"kill\" is significantly delayed on the soundtrack for dramatic effect (a slight echo is also applied to it).

Pappas said it was 7:30pm and it was very dark. If they only had 1 month left to catch the robbers before the end of summer that would make it late August, early September. Day Light Saving Time would be in effect and it would still be light outside.","Revealing mistakes: As Warchild stands by the window, Utah comes running in from the adjacent room and tackles him through it. If you look carefully, you can see him actually sitting in a crouching position for a few seconds before his cue to come running in.","Continuity: When Bodhi shows Jonny the 'kidnap' tape in the back of the van, the monitor is a small, approx 5 inch portable device with dials down the right-hand side and the VCR underneath.

The average free fall takes 50 to 60 seconds from roughly 13,000ft. 4,000 ft is still considered a safe jumping altitude but would require immediate deployment of the parachute, also known as a \"hop and pop\".

It has been suggested that the correct principle is the \"Hawthorne Effect\", which states that a subject group being studied is affected from the simple fact that it is studied. However, the \"Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\" includes a theory that the act of measuring something can change the value of whatever you are measuring, which fits into how Dr. Malcolm was talking about Sarah's scientific measurement causing the change in dinosaur behavior, not the kind of environment the dinosaur is in. Also, Dr. Malcolm would be more likely to know the Heisenberg Principle than the Hawthorne because of his line of work in chaos theory.","Crew or equipment visible: After Ian and Sarah have the infant T-Rex in the back seat of the red convertible, as Ian turns into the gas station, in Ian's rear-view mirror you can see a brief reflection of Steven Spielberg [/name/nm0000229/] with baseball cap directing the scene.","Revealing mistakes: When Eddie Carr returns to save Ian, Nick and Sarah, he enters the truck using the windshield frame. At the moment he jumps in, he puts his hand on a piece of glass without suffering any damage, giving the idea that it was not a real piece of glass from the broken windshield.","Continuity: At the end of the waterfall scene after the T-Rex leaves, Ian joins Nick, Sarah, and Kelly inside the waterfall yet the next time they are seen, they are already dry with little to no explanation as to how that happened so quickly.","Revealing mistakes: At one point when Dieter Stark is being attacked by ProCompsagnathi the dinosaurs are seen running down the side of a ravine in the background knocking aside brush. After the last dinosaur has made it's way down, the brush can be seen moving though no dinosaurs are running through it.","Errors in geography: CNN correspondent mentioned the ship was 206 nautical miles (206NM) from its destination in Costa Rica, halfway there. Even in a straight line crossing over land, it's over 1300NM from San Diego to Costa Rica, way more than twice 206NM.","Revealing mistakes: In the scene after the rampage by the dinosaurs in camp and the burning vehicle goes flying through the air and into a tree you can clearly see the top of the tree give way and buckle under the weight and then return to its previous position, it does it again at the base as the vehicle falls onto it.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Harding smash through the gate on their way to get \"the kid\" T-Rex, the misspelled sign says \"No Tresspassing\".","Revealing mistakes: When the Rexes attack Eddie in the car they bite the driver's seat off and it deploys the airbag. A real airbag would inflate much faster and with a different sound than the one in the movie. This is because the deployment of an actual airbag could seriously injure the actor; therefore, they created a slower inflating one which accounts for the change in sound as well.","Continuity: Near the end of the film where Dr. Ian Malcolm and Dr. Sarah Harding crash through the Ingen security gate, there is no rear view mirror attached to the windscreen, yet, when they pull up to get the baby T-Rex, there clearly is one.","Crew or equipment visible: SPOILER: Reflected in the glass door just before the Tyrannosaurus rex eats a person outside the video store.","Crew or equipment visible: SPOILER: Near the end of the movie, we see people run by a store. As the camera tracks closer to the store's double doors, you can see the legs and shoes of the cameraman tracking in with his Steadicam.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When the T-Rex is on his trek through the city streets, a woman backs up her BMW, screaming. However, right before it hits another car, we see the driver is not the same woman, but a person looking back focusing on where they are going, even as the woman's screams are heard.","Continuity: SPOILER: Towards the end of the movie, in the first close-up of the bus going down the street, there is an extra seated just behind the driver. When the T-Rex crashes its head into the bus, the extra behind the driver disappears even though the seat he was on is clearly in shot.","Continuity: SPOILER: At the end of the movie, the CNN correspondent (on the ship returning to the island) mentions that they are 206 nautical miles from the island and moving at 20 knots, estimating an arrival time of 11:30 am ET. This suggests that it's about 1:30 am ET now, or 10:30 pm PT, yet the scene is set at sunrise (or sunset). Since they're halfway, you may draw your own conclusions about the continuity of their departure time.","Errors in geography: SPOILER: It is impossible for a vessel to crash into downtown San Diego coming from the Pacific Ocean. It would first have to avoid Point Loma, then round North Island on Coronado. The ship carrying the TRex clearly has a straight-on approach on its radar screen; it would have never run into downtown on this course.","Crew or equipment visible: SPOILER: Before the T-Rex eats David Koepp [/name/nm0462895/], he tries to enter a building with windows in the front. You can see two people with shorts coming up to the window, the person on the right carrying some equipment. These are definitely the camera and sound guys - bystanders would run away when they see a T-Rex on the street.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: At the end, the S.S. Venture arrives in port as a derelict with all hands dead. The only dinosaur on this boat is the Rex, contained in the cargo hold. There's no damage to the ship, including the cabin. The scene is a fragment from an earlier version of the film in which Velociraptors infiltrated the ship and killed all hands on board.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: As the T-Rex approaches the swimming pool in the suburbs, the water in the pool never ripples, as it does all throughout the rest of the movie.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): SPOILER: When Dr. Malcolm sees the arriving helicopters, he holds the binoculars to his eyes backwards.","Continuity: SPOILER: Whenever the ship crashes, the people go on to examine it. Before the T-Rex is released someone goes into the control room and sees a hand on the steering wheel. Nothing is wrong with the windows or room and the T-Rex couldn't have fit his head in the doorway. (However, there was a scene that was cut that showed Velociraptors jumping on the SS Venture and attacking crew-members.)","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When the T-Rex escapes from the ship, and into the US Customs center before heading towards San Diego, it walks by a window filled with people acting as is nothing happened - despite a barge crashing into the dock, screaming people, and a roaring T-Rex with thunderous footsteps passing by."],"tt0055106":[],"tt0033367":[],"tt0029694":[],"tt0031077":[],"tt1268987":["Continuity: While watching things unfold in the bunker \"control\", states that 6 assassins are dead, 3 from each team.

He has his boots on for the remainder of the film.","Continuity: Early in the film, Winthrop leans with his hand on the banister, and the banister swings out precariously, nearly sending him to the floor below. When he pulls the banister back into place, he examines what appears to be sawdust on the top of it, in a very thick layer and showing no signs of disturbance from the near-fall or from his hand.","Continuity: When Madeline's coffin is taken to the crypt, the head of the coffin is to the viewer's right.

If you watch Downey Jr.'s upper chest you can clearly see that his actual breathing is out of sync with that of the prosthetic chest.","Continuity: When Tony Stark drives his Audi R8 to Disney Hall for the benefit event, there is no front license plate affixed to the vehicle. However, when he pulls up to the entrance, his \"STARK4\" vanity plate is clearly visible on the front of the car.","Continuity: When Tony Stark is being interviewed by Christine Everhart, his goatee is small, thin, and pointed, and his mustache appears almost drawn-on. The following morning, after seducing her, his goatee and mustache have grown, becoming round and full, in far too little time to be natural.","Revealing mistakes: Several of the devices in Tony's home display live transcriptions of what Tony says. In some cases, the transcript appears slightly before Tony says the words.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Tony asks Pepper to exchange the power cell in his chest the black and white leads of the ECG monitor are reversed.","Continuity: When Tony Stark is working at his computer, his coffee mug is upside down. In the next shot, it is right side up and partially filled with coffee.","Continuity: When Pepper brings a cup of coffee balanced on a brown paper wrapped parcel, the parcel is on its side (taped ends are horizontal, box is on its longer side). When Tony later moves the coffee mug and proceeds to unwrap the parcel, the taped ends are now at the top rather than the side (it's resting on its shorter side).","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): One of the Air Force personnel says that an \"AWAC\" is in the area. \"AWACS\" is an acronym (Airborne Warning and Control System) and it is incorrect to refer to a single AWACS aircraft as an \"AWAC.\"","Revealing mistakes: When the terrorists are filming Tony Stark's hostage video, the blank firing plug is very visible through the slits on the flash suppressor of the rifle being held to his head.","Continuity: Stark secures his upgraded power supply in his chest by turning it clockwise (from our point of view) until it clicks into place. When Stane steals it, he also turns it clockwise to unlock and remove it, instead of counterclockwise.","Continuity: The amount of grain on the bags that Yinsen is lying on in the cave changes in between shots.","Continuity: When Yinsen is showing Tony the picture of the Jericho the terrorist wants him to build, his hand position holding the picture changes between the in-front and point-of-view shots.","Crew or equipment visible: Crew are visible in the reflection of Yinsen's glasses outside of the cave when Tony \"agrees\" to create the Jericho missile.","Crew or equipment visible: When Pepper is replacing the miniature arc reactor in Tony's chest, the prosthetic chest piece used to make a hole for the reactor to go in is clearly seen.

When Rhodes mans the gun, it's changed to a 50-cal.","Continuity: In the opening scene where Tony Stark is in the \"funvee\" with AC/DC playing, drink in hand, there's some kind tape glue residue (like duct tape would leave) on his window that is inconsistently visible between shots.","Continuity: While Stark is working on the flight stabilizers, Pepper brings down a box with a cup of coffee on top of it. Following that, Stark eventually goes upstairs, talks with Stane, comes back down, finishes the stabilizers, tests them, builds the entire prototype suit, test flies it, returns and picks the coffee up off the top of the box. Steam can be seen coming off the cup even though it's probably hours, if not days, old.","Factual errors: In the movie, JARVIS gives Tony the altitude record of the SR-71 Blackbird as 85,000 feet, but this is only the Operational Ceiling, with the maximum altitude of 100,000 feet.","Revealing mistakes: Newspaper clipping dated Friday December 17 2001, during the award ceremony telling about Stark's parents' death. However, December 17 2001 was a Monday.","Continuity: When Pepper is helping Tony replace the power source in his chest, her hand alternates from dry to wet to dry to wet again with the \"pus\".","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Outside the press conference, Tony pulls one Burger King cheeseburger out of the bag Hogan is holding and is seen finishing it in the next scene when he is walking to the podium. But, when Tony is seated and begins talking about his father, he pulls the cheeseburger out of his pocket and begins eating it. When Stan asked if he had one for him, Stark replied that there was only one left, suggesting he bought more than one. In fact, he did buy more than one burger as he was finishing one when he was getting out of the car. There is a good chance that he placed one in his coat pocket before reaching for the last one in the bag. When Stane asked him if he had one for him he had one open in his hand getting ready to eat it and one in his pocket for to eat later.","Factual errors: Stark falls off of one plane and another plane flies through him shearing off its left wing. The plane immediately starts a clockwise roll as if the right wing's weight would cause the right side of the plane to dip. In actuality the plane would roll counter clockwise because the only lift is from the right wing so it would rise.","Factual errors: In the beginning sequence when Tony Stark is in Afghanistan riding in a HMMWV without armor protection with several US Air Force Airmen. An up armored HMMWV's doors have very thick armor and glass. You can tell by looking at the blast holes in the side of the vehicle this is not an armored variant of the HMMWV. This is almost impossible. Months after the US military attacked Afghanistan a General Order was made that prohibited non up-armored HMMWV's from leaving any base camps. Certainly, if Tony Stark was traveling with the US military he would have been afforded the highest level of security.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: The Afghan people speak in Arabic which is wrong. In fact, Afghan people speak in Ordu, Pashtu and Farsi, not Arabic. However, Yinsen tells Tony that the group that captures him speak many different languages. So any Afghan people talking in a different language than their own is plausible.","Factual errors: Rhody wears his MIT class ring (The Brass Rat) backward, with the rat (really a beaver) facing him. Undergraduates wear the ring facing them. After graduation, they turn the ring around.","Continuity: In the first scene were the two Humvee's are traveling in the desert. As the 1st Humvee explodes, the shot quickly jumps to outside showing the exploding Humvee with the 2nd behind it. Then the shot quickly changes again showing the 2nd Humvee in front of the exploded one. Then it changes back to a view from within the 2nd Humvee and the exploded one is in front of it again.","Factual errors: Though it makes for a good kidnapping, in reality, US soldiers are specifically trained to never to stop when ambushed in a convoy.","Continuity: During the movie that Pepper's bangs vary in length. At the party, Pepper's bangs are short and fall just above her eyes. During the fight sequence while Pepper is with the government agents, her bangs are short and barely able to be pushed behind her ears. But the following day when she is helping Tony prepare for the press conference her hair is longer as if she never had bangs in the first place.","Revealing mistakes: Shortly after Tony gets back, he and Stane are walking to the arc reactor and Stane has a cigar. Stane accidentally touches the end of the cigar, which should have burned him.","Revealing mistakes: A magazine cover announces that Tony Stark 'takes the reigns' at his company, rather than the correct 'reins'. Some people have suggested that the this could be a pun made by the magazine, however wordplay of this type would need to make contextual sense in order to be used by a Forbes. In this particular context, 'reigns' is clearly incorrect.","Factual errors: The lead F-22 Raptor pursuing Iron Man is firing a 30mm GSh-30-1 cannon. The rate of fire is insufficiently fast for a Raptor's actual cannon armament, the 20mm M61A2 Vulcan.","Factual errors: In the opening scene a rocket is seen burrowing into the dirt next to Tony before exploding. The warhead is clearly blue and likely a Mk 153 SMAW round. Any munition in use with the military that is blue (such as the SMAW Common Practice Round) is used for the sole purpose of training and would therefore not explode.","Revealing mistakes: The woman holding her son in the scene where Iron Man saves the villagers by shooting darts on the bad guys has a French manicure.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Tony states that calculations \"always are [correct]\". Yet twice in the film (when he first tests the boots and gauntlets) he drastically underestimates their force.","Revealing mistakes: CNBC's two streaming tickers indicate the exchange stocks are traded on. The upper is NYSE, the lower is NASDAQ. Stark Industries has a three letter symbol, indicative of an NYSE listing but the quotes are displayed on both tickers amongst fictional companies named after Mad Money production staff.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When Yinsen asks Tony Stark about the first arc discharge reactors capacity, Stark gives it in gigajoules per second. From this Yinsen calculates that it could sustain his heart for fifty lifetimes. This deduction is impossible, as total running time of a device requires knowledge of total energy produced and not just instantaneous power which Joules per second describes. However, this is not a goof, as Yinsen may have seen some calculations of Stark's and with this new information, reached his conclusion.","Continuity: When Yinsen is pouring the melted palladium, you will see he has poured it and turned the casting cup upright, but then when it switches back, he is seen finishing pouring the palladium again.","Continuity: When Tony Stark is showing Yinsen the schematic for the Iron Man suit, you can clearly see the newly made mini arc reactor glowing in his shirt. Then in the next scene it shows them placing the one in he just made before that scene.","Continuity: At the end of the movie, Pepper Potts removes Tony Stark's handkerchief, fixes it, and replaces it in his breast pocket. When Stark appears for the press conference, he no longer has a handkerchief in his pocket.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Rhodey talks about UAV's as not having the experience or instinct of a pilot. In reality, UAV's are not completely autonomous, but piloted from a command area by a person and thus these arguments against UAV's are void. Rhodey would know this as it's commonly available knowledge.","Continuity: When miniature arc reactor is first implanted into Tony Stark's chest in the cave, the reactor occupies his entire chest. Subsequent scenes throughout the movie show the reactor being smaller.","Continuity: When Tony is video calling Obadiah after the Jericho presentation, Tony's phone has scratches on the screen, but in the next shot they are gone.","Factual errors: The terrorist leader says that the Mongolian Empire was four times the size of Alexander the Great's and twice the size of the Roman Empire. It was actually much bigger: in 1290 it covered 33 million square kilometres, five times the size of the Roman Empire's greatest extent (AD 110: 6.5 million sq. km) and more than six times the Macedonian Empire (323 BC: 5.2 million sq. km).","Revealing mistakes: When Pepper prepares to overload the reactor Tony instructs her to open all circuits and hit the master override. The circuit breakers are ratcheting style they cannot be placed in the open position by pumping the handle. To open the circuit the operator must press the trip button. Also on the close up the contact position indicator clearly shows the breaker in the closed position.","Continuity: When Pepper is putting the new arc reactor in Tony's chest in one shot she is carefully fastening it in place, but in the next shot she still lowering it slowly into his chest.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Stark informs Yinsen of the energy production rate, Yinsen replies, \"That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes\". The arc reactor is keeping shrapnel out of his heart, not running it.","Revealing mistakes: The numerous \"Stark Industries\" weapons seen to be held by the Afghan militants are quite clearly Colt and Hechler & Koch arms, and not even prototypes but fairly common weapons in use across the globe, such as the M4A1 and H&K UMP. Even their attachments are fairly standard scopes, LAMs and auxiliary grenade launchers, not the state of the art weaponry that they are supposed to be.","Factual errors: In the scene where Tony is putting on the MARK1 suit with the help of Yinsen, a few terrorists are shouting through the door. The language they use, as Yinsen tells Tony, is (a heavily broken) Hungarian. In reality, Hungarians have nothing to do with Afghan terrorists.","Revealing mistakes: Pepper is a watching recording of Jim Cramer's Mad Money on CNBC on Sunday, May 8th at 10:04 AM Pacific time. When she receives the \"How big are your hands?\" question from Tony, the remaining time on the recording jumps from 25 minutes to 15 minutes, while the clock stays at 10:04.","Miscellaneous: In the scene where Tony is upgrading the MkII suit to correct the icing problem, one of the screens behind him is taking a real-time transcript of his and Jarvis' dialogue. When Jarvis asks, \"Shall I render using proposed specifications?\", the computer screen says \"utilizing\" instead of \"using.\"","Continuity: When Tony Stark escapes the terrorist camp by flying away in the first suit, he crash lands on his back with his head downhill and his feet uphill. But in the ensuing cut he is buried in the sand on his back with his head uphill and his feet downhill.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When Tony reveals the power generation of the first arc reactor he uses in his chest, he gives it in gigajoules per second (more typically called gigawatts). Since the reactor is generating this much power, the amount of power available to the suit in the ending battle should not be dropping steadily, but should be constant until the reactor stops generating power. However, given the high amount of advanced technology all constantly being run at the same time while the suit is operational, it's entirely plausible that the suit is using more energy per second than the reactor is generating (i.e. JARVIS' comment that the Mark I chestpiece was not designed for *sustained* flight), resulting in a steady loss of total power available and causing him to switch to the backup power source while the reactor catches back up.","Factual errors: Molten palladium is incandescent (about 1550°C), glowing yellow-white if not white-hot. The palladium that Yinsen pours is nowhere near that temperature; it is not even at red heat.","Revealing mistakes: At the benefit party, when Tony Stark gets the two Martinis at the bar, the girl to his right looks into the camera for an instant.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Tony Stark mentions the altitude record for a fixed wing aircraft at 80000ft for an SR-71. The actual record is held by the Russian Mig 25 Foxbat at 120000ft.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the sequence when the Air Force fighters try to shoot down Iron Man, LTC Rhodes calls the Air Force officer in charge of the ops center \"Major\" when the subdued rank on his uniform indicates that he is a Lieutenant Colonel.","Factual errors: SPOILER: Ironman encounters icing on his suit at his greatest altitude and assumes that the higher he flies the more likely Iron Monger will suffer from icing. Icing only occurs in visible moisture, cloud, fog or rain, of which there was none, plus it only occurs at temperatures of TAT +10 degrees C or below and above a static air temperature of -40 deg C. As Ironman was not in visible moisture and at the altitude that was quoted the air temp would be below -40, then there would have been no icing (and incidentally would be more likely to ice up on descent if he passed through clouds on his way down with the cold temperature of the suit)."],"tt0078872":["Continuity: The layout of the cards in the solitaire game Henry is playing while talking to Alec changes from shot to shot.","Anachronisms: The horse statue on Alec's nightstand was one made by Breyer Animal Creations in the late 1970's shortly before the movie came out.

Although Crested Butte is 28 miles north of Gunnison on CO-135, there is no Greyhound transportation of any kind to Crested Butte. Additionally, Greyhound offers no services on their fleet of buses to Gunnison itself, as these are contracted out to another bus company, Black Hills Stage Lines, Inc.","Errors in geography: Although some scenes of the film take place in the sewer system underneath Gunnison - no such system exists. The Gunnison sewer system is limited to piping, and does not include underground catwalks.","Revealing mistakes: When Kelly comes home in her uniform. Her Flag patch and unit patch are reversed. The flag goes on the right shoulder, not the left. The unit patch goes on the left shoulder, not the right.","Revealing mistakes: Kelly is wearing a US Marine Corps digital camouflage uniform with a US Army name tape.","Errors in geography: There are no nuclear power plants in Colorado and no power plant of any kind in Gunnison.","Continuity: In the opening scene when you see Predator on the table before the pred-alien bursts out, the table is actually completely different to that of AVP: Alien vs. Predator [/title/tt0370263/] (2004). The markings in the first movie has Predator script reading vertical whereas in AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem [/title/tt0758730/] (2007) they are just lights running horizontal.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): At the beginning of the movie when the hunters find the downed space ship, one hunter uses the butt of his gun to tap the ship. While he is doing this, he points the barrel of his rifle at his kids head. This is not the safest way to use the gun, especially considering he is taking his young son hunting.","Factual errors: The M4 Carbines wielded by the main characters are seen firing off more than their 30-round magazine without being reloaded.","Revealing mistakes: When Wolf is walking in the sewer, one of the shot is reversed, notable by his whip and wrist blades being on the left side.","Anachronisms: In AVP: Alien vs. Predator [/title/tt0370263/] (2004) it is clearly stated that it takes place on October 10th 2004.

Night vision devices are considered \"sensitive items\" they are closely accounted for and soldiers are not released from duty unless their sensitive items are properly accounted for. The military considers these items the same as weapons.","Errors in geography: The Nation Guard is called from Colorado Springs and they arrive shortly. Colorado Springs is 3 hours away from Gunnison.","Factual errors: When the guy is firing the Glock from the helicopter, he empties it, the slide locks back, but sound effects are added for a revolver hammer falling on an empty cylinder. Glocks, and most other semi-autos, make no sound after the slide locks back and the trigger is squeezed.","Continuity: When the sheriff is leaving the group to go to the \"airlift\", and the other are deciding, Jesse's gun is visible against the light in the tank. The slide is shown to be pulled back, meaning it it out of ammo. However, she is yet to even fire her weapon, and she would still have bullets in the gun.","Factual errors: The Colorado National Guard are depicted as being armed with fully automatic M4A1 carbines. M4A1s are normally only issued to Special Operations troops. Standard Colorado National Guardsmen should have the basic M4 carbine, which has a three-round burst.","Revealing mistakes: The Interceptor body armor scavenged from the slain National Guardsmen quite obviously do not contain the hard boron-carbide SAPI (Small Arms Protective Inserts) plates, which create a distinctive flat outline against the vest.","Factual errors: SPOILER: Since Gunnison covers only 3 sq. mi., Colonel Stevens's map is showing a \"pressure damage\" radius of barely 1/4 mile. In reality a 200KT nuclear explosion would level all structures within at least one mile. The \"heat damage\" radius on Stevens's screen is even more understated.","Continuity: SPOILER: Ricky gets stabbed through the shoulder by the pred-alien in the hospital but later shots show no blood or damage to his flak-jacket.","Factual errors: SPOILER: Ricky gets stabbed through the shoulder by the pred-alien in the hospital and later uses his injured arm several times in a way that would be pretty much impossible after suffering such a major wound in that location, not just because of the incapacitating pain but because of the gaping hole he'd have where some of the necessary muscles would be.","Continuity: SPOILER: Before the helicopter lifts off, Kelly kills an alien by shooting through the windshield. Later, when the helicopter is in flight and attempting to escape the nuclear blast, the bullets holes are gone.","Continuity: SPOILER: Leading up to and including the final battle atop the hospital, all of the action takes place during a heavy downpour. Later the same morning at dawn, when the survivors are found by the soldiers, the entire area is completely dry. While this is possible, based on the amount of time the helicopter was airborne, it is not very likely.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Jessie is impaled by the Predator's shurikens, she is seen being lifted before the blades actually hit her.","Factual errors: SPOILER: When the F-22 Raptor arrives over the town and releases the \"nuke\" it is traveling at near supersonic speeds (to allow it to escape the blast radius of the weapon). However the bomb is seen to \"free fall\" at a near vertical angle, and only deploys its retarding fins moments before detonating. In reality, when deploying a weapon with retarding fins attached, the fins spring open immediately after clearing the bomb bay to maximize the available time for the aircraft to clear the lethal radius of the weapon. Also, the B-83 nuclear weapon does not employ retarding fins to slow its descent, it uses a Kevlar parachute.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When the helicopter is riding the shock wave of the blast, the horizon indicator is shown spinning. This would only be possible if it were flying on a corkscrew trajectory, which it is not being shown as doing.","Errors in geography: SPOILER: On Col. Stevens monitor displaying the bomber and delta force helicopter, the motifs used appear to be that of a Panavia Tornado (as opposed to the depicted F22 Raptor)and Westland Lynx (as opposed to the labeled Blackhawk). Both of these are European, despite being used on a display aboard a USAF E3 presumably built (and programmed) by US engineers.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): SPOILER: On the screen showing the purported \"damage assessment\" of the tactical nuclear weapon, in the lower part of the screen the bomb is designated as a \"MK 83\".

While still in his soaking clothes, Trehearne pulls a dry folded piece of paper from his pocket.","Continuity: When Trehearne and Sir Humphrey are sharing a drink, the Squire drinks holding the glass with his left hand and sets it down using his right.","Continuity: A wave comes up, about to crash over the left side of the ship (in the opening scene). In the next shot, the wave is coming from behind.","Continuity: When Mary takes off Jem's rope, she is on his left side.

It's quite long at the beginning, and a lot smaller at the end.","Revealing mistakes: In a flashback, Duke is almost in the doorway of a house when it explodes. He walks away with a few cuts. Later, when the ICBMs are launched, none of the Joes suffers any heat burns or effect of the thrust, despite standing a few meters away.","Revealing mistakes: When the Cobra plane lands at the Snow Base, the engines do not kick up any snow, nor does the thrust melt the snow directly under the jets.","Factual errors: Ripcord's plane has a top speed of Mach 6, about 4,600 miles per hour. Moscow is 4,800 miles from Washington DC. To shoot down the missiles over D.C., he would need to cover that distance in 15 minutes, and his plane would need to travel Mach 25 (over 19,000 mph).","Revealing mistakes: When Scarlett fights Ana in the invisible suit, Anna isn't wearing any gloves. When she turns on the invisibility, her hands disappear.","Continuity: FLIPPED SHOT: When the Joes attack McCullen's lair under the polar ice cap, one shot of Heavy Duty driving a small underwater attack vessels shows his earring in his right ear instead of his left.","Continuity: When Duke cases the Baroness in the woods, the box switches between her left and right hands during the scene.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Scarlett suggests that Ripcord's aircraft needs verbal commands in the Celtic language. The Celts were a group of tribal societies that spread over much of western Europe; the original proto-Celtic language split into several different local languages. However, since Destro is Scottish, Scarlett could've easily narrowed it down to Goidelic Celtic, the root of modern Scottish Gaelic. If the Celtic didn't work, modern Gaelic would've been an obvious alternative.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): During the infiltration of the MARS base, Snake Eyes crosses a corridor lined with pressure plates by walking on his fingertips after Scarlett says anything \"larger than a quarter\" will set them off. Pressure plates are triggered by the weight over a defined area. Walking on his fingertips would increase the pressure on each plate, since the fingertips cover less area than the feet. A solution is to increase the area of contact, so the weight is distributed over a larger area, with less pressure on each plate.","Continuity: When Storm Shadow boards the plane in Paris, he is wearing all-white civilian-style clothes. While in the plane headed to the Cobra base, he wears his white ninja outfit, complete with swords. When he lands, he leaves the plane in his civilian clothes.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Although Scotland and France were allies in 1641, the charge against McCullen was selling arms to enemies of the crown, with no other specifics given.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Duke has a goatee throughout the movie. It may be acceptable for some US Special Operations Soldiers in combat zones, but it is not allowed in garrison environments, especially at a formal function with a dress blue uniform.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When the self-destruct destroys the ice above the Cobra snow base, the ice sinks into the water, destroying the base. The ice should float, but the interior of the ice was part of the underwater base, with numerous rooms, passageways, hangars, and elevator shafts, which would have added considerable weight, causing the ice structures to sink once they started to break apart. Heavy Duty says \"there is going to be whole lot of ice and metal coming down on top of you.\"","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Early on, Destro says that \"You've tossed the caber out of the park!\" Caber tossing is judged on skill and precision, not distance. Tossing a caber out the park would likely result in a very poor score.","Continuity: The Joes are 2 km from the Eiffel Tower when they report the area is being evacuated. When they finally arrive at the tower, the area beneath the tower is crowded.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When the nanites are demonstrated to the NATO command, one soldier's laptop is open to the Windows Log In screen. That screen comes up if the user presses a key after a password-protected screen saver has been triggered.","Revealing mistakes: When Ripcord jumps through the train in Paris, he has a perpendicular trajectory inside, as if the train is not moving.","Revealing mistakes: Young Storm Shadow speaks Korean, not Japanese.","Continuity: After Stormshadow and the Baroness' Hummer crashes, blood flows from the top of her head. When the Baroness gets into the elevator, there is no blood on her face. Blood re-appears on her cheek as she goes up in the elevator, and flows down her head again at the top of the building.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When the warheads are stolen at the G.I. Joe headquarters, Duke grabs an AA-12 shotgun, a fully automatic 12-gauge shotgun. When he shoots it, it sounds like an M16.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: In the underwater chase, the camera eventually cuts to a shot of Duke from behind as he pilots the craft, and he says \"I'm not lettin' those two get away.\" You can see Duke's reflection in the glass, and his lips are not moving.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: The CGI tram ramming the Hummer during the Paris chase, loosely based on the Paris \"Tramway des Maréchaux\", looks nothing like the actual tram. The movie is set in the future; things change.","Continuity: When Duke and Rex are in their dress blues, both have the rank of Major. In the firefight, the rank on Rex's hat is Corporal. Throughout the movie, Duke is called Captain, not Major.","Errors in geography: In Tokyo, young Snake Eyes searches through an aluminum trash can. Japan has no aluminum trash cans; trash is put into latticed grilled dumpsters called \"gomi-stations\" or \"trash stations\".","Factual errors: During M.A.R.S./Cobra's first attempt to steal the warheads, Duke and the other soldiers on escort duty stand in a line to meet the attackers. Trained soldiers would have sought cover or concealment and returned fire from behind trees, disabled vehicles, and other terrain.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): While cleaning up \"The Pit\", just before Snake Eye's 20-year flashback, one Joe sweeps trash into the shovel of a second Joe, who immediately dumps it on the ground.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: At the start of the movie, McCullen (a Scot) is accused of \"treason\" for selling arms to overthrow the king of France. French law allows \"soldiers in the service of France\" to be charged with treason. As an arms dealer to France, particularly at that time, McCullen could very well have been considered a soldier in the service of France.","Continuity: In the submarine, when Scarlett noted the advantages of a military base under the polar icecap, the shot switches between closeup on her to showing the rest of the team. In the closeup, her shoulder is behind the gold pole. In wider views, her shoulder is completely on one side of the pole as she leans on it.","Errors in geography: The Cobra Base is said to be located beneath the Arctic ice cap. This is confirmed by the presence of polar bears and mention of the 'northern route'. The Arctic ice cap is a very thin (10 meters at most), flat, loosely connected aggregation of ice plates, nothing you can build big structures on or in. Several mountains are in the background, even though the Arctic has no mountains. The Antarctic ice cap is several kilometers thick, above a rock shelf.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: In Kyrgyzstan, Duke and crew head for Ganci. The USAF officially changed the name to Manas Air Base in 2002 or 2003, in honor of a NYC Fire Chief who died at the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001. Official US policy dictates that only bases within the US are named after people, while bases overseas are named after local towns or geographical locations. That may not apply to older bases.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: In the underwater battle, when one of the SHARCs is hit by a missile, the pilot is flung out screaming. An underwater scream sounds very different from a scream on the surface.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Breaker immediately says he was \"acting\" for McCullen after the nanomites eat the neoviper in Paris, but he couldn't possibly know they weren't still watching through the button camera, so he would have given away that it was an act.","Continuity: When Duke is talking to Baroness in the plane after disarming the nanobots, Storm Shadow is wearing a white button shirt. When it cuts to him he is wearing a jacket with swords on his back.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Army personnel as are all military can not have a beard let alone a goatee. Both main charters are seen wearing their dress blue at an official Army function sporting goatee.","Continuity: When young Storm Shadow and young Snake Eyes fight in the kitchen, Snake Eyes runs across the stove as Storm Shadow turns on the burners. A few seconds later the burners are off, and Snake Eyes even throws Storm Shadow on the now-off stove.","Revealing mistakes: Flipped shot. During the young Snake Eyes-Storm Shadow flashback, Hard Master has his yellow robe draped over his left shoulder and his beard sweeping to the right. When Hard Master says \"[Snake Eyes] does not fight like [a weakling]\" the shot is flipped with the yellow robe over the right shoulder and the beard swept to the left.","Continuity: When Storm Shadow & Snakes Eyes battle for the first time as kids, Storm Shadow hits Snake Eyes with a frying pan. As Snake Eyes supposedly gets hit, he does a back flip and lands face down, head towards camera. When you see him get up, he is on his back with his head away from the camera.","Continuity: When Duke and Ripcord are chasing the Hummer, in several shots the Gatling Gun is shown mounted on their right arms, but when they fire the Gatling gun at the Hummer, Duke fires from his left hand.","Continuity: The President's \"American\" accent slips back to Jonathan Pryce [/name/nm0000596/]'s native English accent several times.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: While Rex Lewis was uploading the data on the nanomites on the computer inside the bunker, the keyboard he is using is a portable silicone gel model while the sound it makes is of a plastic key keyboard.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When the Baroness tries to steal the nanites, Duke and Ripcord's military convoy has civilian Hummer H2s, not military Humvees.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: SPOILER: Young Storm Shadow knocks young Snake Eyes on his back as they fight in the kitchen.

The ideal design is so that patients who walk in with broken arms do not walk out with other maladies. However, many hospital HVAC systems are not correctly maintained, and others are not correctly designed - some/many have exam rooms that share air. So when the virus in the movie mutates and is air born, it could be spread by the HVAC System especially in a community hospital that isn't geared up for contagious diseases. In fact, the Llassa fever virus was spread exactly this way in a major US east coast medical center. One person, a tech working on a non-patient floor, contracted the virus even though extreme containment procedures were thought to be in place - the HVAC system was assumed to be the pathway.","Factual errors: Salt comments that their Loach (Hughes H-6) will go 400 miles without refueling. The Hughes H-6's real range is only 267 miles.","Factual errors: Blue suits used in level 4 laboratories have a special air supply. The sound this makes inside the suit is so loud that you cannot hear other people. The people at the starting scene of the movie communicates none the less during the first scenes in the level 4 laboratory. Yellow suits are pressurized (positive pressure, which means air can go out if torn, but never in) via a small motor inside it and a set of batteries, but the yellow suits show no sign of being inflated at all, and when helmets are moved no air rushes out. It means also that Casey tearing his suit shouldn't have ended with infection.","Crew or equipment visible: The civilians killed attempting to escape quarantine in the pick-up truck from the military Hummers, are clearly dummies on fire.","Anachronisms: At the opening of the film, the setting is said to be \"Zaire, 1967\". The country was only called Zaire between 1971 and 1997. In 1967, the country was called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was also the name it reverted to after 1997.","Errors in geography: The H-6 only has a range of 267 miles. Looking at the direction as Daniels and Salt are flying the helicopter along the coast line, it is clear that they are flying south from Cedar Creek to San Francisco. Now, there are five Cedar Creeks north of San Francisco, the closest one located 180 miles northeast of San Francisco. This Cedar Creek is far from the coast though. The Cedar Creek that is closest to the coast is a whopping 323 miles away, so the flight to SFO and back plus standing in the air against the plane would never have worked without refueling. All of the Cedar Creeks are real creeks anyway, and uninhabited. When preparing for the way back to Cedar Creek Daniel mentions a town called Palisades between San Francisco and Cedar Creek. There is no such town.","Factual errors: Maj. Gen. Donald McClintock has a Special Forces tab over the Special Forces patch on his right shoulder. This patch represents former overseas combat assignment. The tab is a service school qualification tab to be worn only on the left shoulder according to Army Regulation 670-1.","Factual errors: Maj Salt flies the helicopter from the left seat. U.S. Army helicopters can be flown from either seat but can only be started from the right (pilot/command) seat as the engine starter controls are only accessible from the right side. Also, Maj Salt, being the pilot, would have sat in the right seat even though Col. Daniels outranked him.","Continuity: When Salt looks out the window and notices the troops leaving town they are next to the MPH sign and marching down the street. When he looks out again, after about two minutes, the troops are still marching, but their position has not changed.","Revealing mistakes: In the scene where Col. Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) enters a crewman's room aboard the Korean ship. The Korean flag is shown upside down.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Keough is trying to interview Jimbo in the hospital ICU, he is clearly intubated. Intubated patients can not talk due to the fact that the intubation tube passes through their vocal cords.","Continuity: When McClintock's helicopter goes under the bridge and splashes into the water while chasing Daniels' helicopter, the pilot can be seen wearing sunglasses. He is not wearing sunglasses in closeup shots.","Factual errors: The White House Chief of Staff refers to the fuel-air bomb as \"the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal.\" This has never been true. In 1995, when this film was made, the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal was the BLU-82 \"Daisy Cutter,\" which is indeed the bomb shown in the film, but which is not a fuel-air bomb. (This weapon was retired in 2001 and replaced by the GBU-43 MOAB bomb, which is currently the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal, and which isn't a fuel-air bomb, either.)","Errors in geography: When Daniels and Salt talk to George at the San Francisco Federal Building, George says he is from Sioux City, SD.

This looks like a continuity error, but it is not - the confusion comes from the elaborate \"special effect\" of weightlessness generated with a rotating set and magnetic boots. The crew was squatting on the \"wall\" of the cabin and looking \"out\" through a round porthole on the outer wall of the ship, not down through the floor. There is indeed a round airlock door that leads down into a lower cabin where the spacesuits are kept, but it is not the same round port they looked through to see outside.

In reality, avionics computers are small, ruggedized embedded systems which are distributed throughout the plane. Avionics computing requires highly reliable redundant systems, not massive computing power.","Revealing mistakes: A shot of the cockpit shows 2 sets of engine instruments. When the aircraft is shown, it has 4 engines.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Throughout the film, the characters refer to the passengers leaving the plane as \"deboarding\". In the airline industry, this is called \"deplaning.\" Boarding a plane is called \"enplaning.\"","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): As the plane is speeding down the runway in Berlin, Kyle is seen buckling her seat belt and a flight attendant is walking down the aisle. Air travel regulations require that seat belts be fastened before aircraft taxiing. Flight crews are supposed to be seated and buckled in as well.","Continuity: A short while after the oxygen masks come down only a few masks are still hanging.

For some reason the FBI is in charge at the airport. However, the RCMP has jurisdiction in Canada, not the FBI. Also, the FBI claim that they are holding the coroner in Berlin, but they have no jurisdiction in Germany.","Revealing mistakes: When you see the shot of the landing gear touching down on the runway on landing, notice the aircraft does not flare. (Flaring an aircraft means to bring the nose up on landing so that the main landing gear touches down first, then the nose gear. If a plane lands as shown in the movie, there is a risk of the landing gear collapsing, causing the aircraft to crash.)","Factual errors: Over the course of the movie, Kyle's search for her daughter takes us further and further into the various compartments and holds of the aircraft, eventually taking us into areas far beneath flight deck. The problem here is with the layout of the bowels of the aircraft. As shown, this airliner's computer room is large and cavernous, with much empty and unused space. In reality, virtually every square inch of any passenger liner has a purpose, and with the exception of passenger and crew areas, every other part of an airliner is unbelievably cramped, filled with cargo, electronics, hydraulics, or emergency equipment. Such a waste of space, as depicted in this film, simply wouldn't exist.","Revealing mistakes: At one point Kyle is in the galley with most of the plane's crew (at least all the ones we've been introduced to) and its captain. The camera takes a rotating view of Kyle and at the end of its rotation on the left-hand side, the smallest bit of \"untreated\" green screen is visible.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The PA at the airport in Berlin welcomes the passengers to \"Berlin International airport\". However, Berlin does not have one, but two international airports, Tegel and Schönefeld (and at the time of the movie, also Tempelhof), so the PA would have specified which one.","Revealing mistakes: When the airplane is shown being \"de-iced\" before takeoff, it is obvious that the trucks are simply spraying soapy water all over the airplane. Real de-icing/anti-icing fluid is applied only to the wing and tail surfaces, and would not be wasted on the passenger windows. Furthermore, real de-icing/anti-icing fluid (treated propylene glycol) is pinkish, gooey, and very expensive.","Revealing mistakes: In the exterior shot at the airport you can clearly see that the \"Leipzig/Halle Airport\" signs at the jet bridge are pasted over because the adhesive foil color does not match exactly the color of the jet bridge."],"tt0177226":["Boom mic visible: In the swimming pool scene the boom mic is completely exposed.","Continuity: In the opening scene, in the far shots of the initiation, the two pledges are sitting on one red platform each, both basically on the floor.

In the immediately preceding scene the Japanese officers discuss whether their remaining planes should be armed with torpedoes (to attacks ships) or bombs (to attack Midway).","Continuity: When Tom Garth lands his plane after the attack on the Japanese carriers, his face is blackened from the fire in the cockpit. When the crew takes him out of the plane and places him on the stretcher, his face is dirty, but not blackened.","Revealing mistakes: Just before the gunner on Ensign Gay's plane is shot, the spots where the \"bullets\" will hit the plane can be clearly seen.

The Aerials would be lowered for flight operations.","Continuity: As Torpedo Sqn. 8 turns to attack the Japanese carriers, it can be clearly seen that they have no weapons underneath the aircraft.","Miscellaneous: In the beginning of the scene where USS Enterprise and USS Hornet are leaving Pearl Harbor, it has a shot panning across Pearl Harbor showing an aircraft carrier marked \"3\" (meaning CV-3 USS Saratoga). But it is not a Lexington class ship (the class of ship that the USS Saratoga belonged to) it appears to be an Essex class carrier that someone has changed the number on (probably CV-9 USS Essex).","Factual errors: In all the overhead shots of the carriers, angled flights decks are clearly visible. Angled flight decks weren't added until the USS Midway's refit, and Japanese carriers were never retrofitted with them.","Continuity: When Tom Garth takes off from the aircraft carrier to attack the Japanese, he's taking off in an F4F Wildcat, but when he returns from the attack, burned and shot up, he lands in an F6F Hellcat.","Factual errors: When the last Japanese carrier is being attacked, Japanese anti-aircraft fire destroys a bomber which explodes in mid-air. The bomber is twin engined (attacking aircraft are all single engined) and German markings are visible on the wingtips. It's unlikely that German bombers took part in the battle of Midway and certainly not attacking allied Japanese shipping.","Anachronisms: Some of the Jeeps in this movie have one piece windshields.

According to his US Navy biography, Nimitz left high school in 1905 to enter the Naval Academy. Annapolis was probably the first time in his life that the future Fleet Admiral saw anything resembling \"flat lands.\"","Factual errors: The movie clearly shows an Iowa Class Battleship. There were no US Battleships at the battle of Midway and the Iowa Class Battleships came out after the Battle of Midway.","Anachronisms: During the Coral Sea sequence, a US flag with 50 stars is shown prior to the Japanese air attack on the US carriers. At the time, there were only 48 states.","Revealing mistakes: In the overhead shots of the carriers the island is on the port side and the angled flight deck on the starboard side. This is backwards and due to film reversal.","Revealing mistakes: There were over 20 scout planes sent to look for the Japanese fleet and a large grid was used to plot their movement. The path of the plane that first spotted the Japanese fleet (\"Strawberry 5\") was circled - before its report was radioed in.","Revealing mistakes: Most of the key officers in this movie are not sporting regulation Navy haircuts. Officers are expected to set an example.","Continuity: During the Coral Sea battle, a crewman shouts that two \"Kates\" are heading for the bow of the American carrier. However, the two aircraft shown, clearly have a crew of one. The \"Kate\" (Nakajima B5N) had an elongated canopy to accommodate a crew of three.","Continuity: The final climatic battle takes place on the open sea, but since shots from \"Tora, Tora, Tora\" were used in this sequence, land based shore facilities can be seen in the background.","Factual errors: The majority of U.S. torpedo bombers used at Midway were of the type called \"Devastators\" and the torpedo carried was clearly visible. Most of the scenes used \"Avengers\" and the torpedo was carried internally and not visible until they were dropped. Some \"Avengers\" were flown at the battle of Midway.","Factual errors: A title card late in the movie lists as June 6, 1942, which was the last day of the Battle of Midway and the day the Hiryu was hit. In fact, all four of the Japanese carriers were hit all on the very same day which was June 4, with the Hiryu being hit late in the afternoon, not two days later.","Revealing mistakes: The scene where two fighters are taking off from Midway are P-40s. This is a reused scene from Tora! Tora! Tora!","Factual errors: When Admiral Pearson very reluctantly agrees to help Captain Garth with his family problems, he says, \"We're even\", meaning that by his taking this action all debts between them have been squared. In response, Captain Garth says \"Aye, aye, sir.\" Any navy man knows that this is incorrect; \"Aye, aye, sir\" does not mean simply, \"Yes, sir.\" It means 1) I hear the order, 2) I understand it, and 3) I will carry it out to the best of my ability.\" Since Admiral Pearson is not issuing an order in this case, the proper response is simply, \"Yes, sir.\"","Anachronisms: Several Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters appear in the movie. This type did not see combat until 1943, the year after this movie takes place.","Continuity: Tom Garth manages to extinguish the cockpit fire and himself while wearing his pilot leather gloves, only to raise his burned arms in a dramatic gesture, but without gloves on his hands.","Factual errors: In the discussion at the bar between Tom's father, Captain Garth and Tom's Commander at sea, Commander Jessop, there was mention of Japanese or Oriental intrigue or secret betrayal and the mention of the responsible person as \"Madame Butterfly,\" which is clearly wrong because she was betrayed by the US Navy in early Japanese-American relationships. The proper name for the screenwriter or the script person to have required was the oriental master spy, \"Mata Hari.\" She used guile and sex to betray and this was the person offensive to US affairs of presence, not \"Madame Butterfly.\"","Factual errors: The movie shows pilots flying SB2C \"Helldiver\" dive bombers, such as the one the elder Garth flies immediately before crashing into the end of the flight deck. The SB2C \"Helldiver\" did not enter service until toward the end of the war and was not available during the Battle of Midway.","Continuity: When Garth is talking to Pearson on the same side of the desk, Pearson is seen with his hands by his side and in the next shot he has a folder in his hands.","Crew or equipment visible: At one point in the conversation between Pearson and Garth in front of the desk, the camera zooms in on them.

Also you can clearly see that it is a stuntman in the reflection of the visor.","Continuity: In the pistol whipping sequence, when you see Preston's pistol in slow motion about to hit a guard's faceplate, you can see the reflection of Preston moving to hit the visor itself. The reflection shows Preston hitting with his left hand, but when the real hand shows up, it is actually his right hand.","Revealing mistakes: After Preston drops off the puppy, he gets into his car and shuts the door. This film is running in reverse - you can see smoke is billowing into the muffler, instead of out.","Continuity: When Preston shows the picture of Partridge to Mary, the picture is shown lying on the table as he walks out of the room.

When Preston shows the picture to Mary it's wrinkled and creased, but one scene later the picture is in a like new condition.","Continuity: When the two guards step through the double doors into the hallway in the final guard shootout scene, the one on the left of the screen steps past the door handle but when the shot cuts to another angle they are scene catching their arm on the door handle and pulling their arm out of the way.","Factual errors: In the beginning of the film, when they discover the Mona Lisa, the picture is actually several times larger than the real Mona Lisa, even though the scan shows that this is the authentic one.","Continuity: The William Butler Yeats [/name/nm0947102/] book that Errol keeps is larger and much thicker when he is reading it in the Nethers, compared to when we see it in the car.","Revealing mistakes: When Preston fights the bodyguards with the swords, as he kills the last two men you can see that the man behind him (whom Preston just stuck a sword through) doesn't hold the first part of the sword in a straight line, but accidentally holds it in an angle as he collapses.","Revealing mistakes: In the katana fight Preston jabs into one of the men, and it's clearly visible the sword misses the torso, and the actor's actually holding it between his arm and against his chest. In normal playback the move looks nevertheless convincing.","Revealing mistakes: In the finishing katana move, where Preston impales one of the fighters to his rear right (screen left), the seam in the theatre sword is clearly visible between the victim's hand and torso.","Continuity: In the scene where Preston shoots Partridge (his predecessor) in the head, the hole in the book and his head changes sizes from being very big in one frame to small in the next to non existent in the last frame.","Revealing mistakes: As Partridge lies dead on the mortuary table, a pulse is visible in his neck.","Revealing mistakes: In the pistol whipping scene, Preston knocks the visor up on the helmeted guard to the left of him.","Revealing mistakes: In the opening sequence when the policemen run around the side of the car, the rear window is smashed before the criminals start shooting.","Continuity: The cut on Preston's lip towards the end of the movie changes size during several of the scenes.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Preston scans the Mona Lisa, his machine reads \"L. da Vinci 1479-1528.\" 'Leonardo da Vinci' lived 1452-1519.","Continuity: When Preston fights the bodyguards with the swords, he impales the last bodyguard through the chest and the sword protrudes out of his back. However, when the bodyguard collapses, the end of the sword is gone and his back appears completely untouched.","Continuity: In the final shoot out where Preston is fighting the guards in the hallway, ho releases the clips out of his guns and new clips come out of his sleeves. The clips that are inserted into the gun are the regular clips he uses, but in the next shot when he begins shooting the clips are obviously the round bottom ones.","Factual errors: A canvas of the Mona Lisa is identified being \"authentic\" by a scanner.

The gun disappears and reappears in his left hand between shots.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Preston is fighting with Brandt in DuPont's office at the end of the film, Brandt drops his Samurai sword. In the next shot we see Brandt dropping to his knees still holding the sword.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Mary is walking into the incinerator, some shots show a man without a helmet standing behind her, but he is missing from other shots.","Continuity: SPOILER: During the gun battle in the corridor outside DuPont's office, some shots show Preston's pistols loaded with the weighted clips before he actually loads them.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Preston is storming the lobby outside father's office, you can see the wires attached to the cartridges he throws out into the middle before he opens fire on the guards.","Continuity: SPOILER: In the fight in the hall outside of DuPont's office, when Preston throws the two gyroclips into the hall and kills the two running guards, the standing guards raise their weapons to fire upon Preston. However, in the wider shot when you see the two dead guards dropping to the ground, all the guards still have their weapons at their sides.","Continuity: SPOILER: After killing DuPont, Preston still has a gun in his hand.

In the next shot, the bullet holes made by the two first guards have disappeared from the wall behind Preston.","Continuity: SPOILER: Before Mary enters the incinerator, she is seen taking off her red robe, but when the door is closed and the shot cuts to her hand, she is still wearing the robe.","Factual errors: SPOILER: It is impossible to see both the sun and a solar rainbow. In order to see a rainbow formed by the sun, a person must be standing with his/her back to the sun.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: SPOILER: When Preston shoots the final two helmeted guards in the room where he was having his emotions monitored during Father/DuPont's speech, there are three muzzle flashes but the sound of four shots being fired.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When DuPont is revealing to Preston that Father's visage has been used as a political puppet some 'cut and paste' work becomes apparent. The words in the speech \"The council simply elected me...\" and \"...to pursue his paternal tradition\" appear to be from different shoots as DuPont's face snaps from one frame to the next to a different position and the tense in his voice dramatically shifts.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Preston shoots out the window that is displaying DuPont's face just after his speech to Preston hooked up to the emotion monitor, the gun in Preston's hand appears to 'double fire' from the same trigger pull. He fires the weapon and there is a muzzle flash but when the angle changes there is a second muzzle flash without him having pulled the trigger a second time.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: Obvious stunt double when Preston does flip mid-air to dodge bullets from the first two guards in the hallway in the final guard shootout scene.","Continuity: SPOILER: During the fight outside DuPont's office, John Preston drops his two pistols (at the end of the hallway fight) and is running up to the assault rifle (the one he flips over his head). As he is running up to body and the rifle, you see the guards running up to the door. Just before the the camera angle switches to the rifle, you see the guard on Preston's right stop and take aim. After Preston gets the rifle and takes aim, it cuts back to the two guards and you yet again see the guard on the right running up to the door and get shot down.","Continuity: SPOILER: At the beginning of the scene where Preston shoots Partridge, Preston puts both his hands before his waist, holding his gun with his left arm and his right is empty.

I get off on her surveillance photos too.\" But he is clearly dubbed over saying, \"Hey, I don't blame you. I beat off to her surveillance photos too.","Revealing mistakes: In the scene with the cars driving under the truck (trailer), the trailer switches from a standard tandem configuration to an obviously rigged (raised) single axle trailer.","Factual errors: Although clearly done for cinematic purposes (to make it obvious what is in the truck), the container full of electronic equipment isn't packed at all realistically, with everything packed at the sides and none of it wrapped in plastic or on pallets. At the first turn, the boxes would be all over the place.","Revealing mistakes: When Paul Walker jumps onto the truck to save the guy, you can very clearly see the safety harness strapped to his back in several shots.","Continuity: When the Supra is chasing the dirt bikes it switches from clean to very dirty many times between shots.","Continuity: In the last race scene with the Supra on the LA streets chasing the dirtbikes during the day, the windshield is clearly cut out to eliminate glare in some shots, while in others, the entire windshield is present. The cutout takes the shape of the area covered by the wiper blades. In the same scene, the windshield is also visibly clean as well as visibly dirty.","Factual errors: The police scanner mounted on the dash on one of the \"lookout\" cars during the street race is an early-'80s Radio Shack Patrolman scanner which is not capable of receiving the current 800mhz digital trunking system currently used by L.A.P.D. and L.A.

When the stop is first being made, the Crown Victoria is a modified one that does not have a front grille with a blue Ford Oval on it. As Paul gets out of his car, the Crown Victoria is an unmodified one, with the grille and Ford oval on the front. So between shots, the police car changes.","Revealing mistakes: During the first race, the cars pass by the same background more than once.","Factual errors: The 1/4 mile race at the end takes the two \"ten second\" cars way more than 10 seconds to run. On top of that, in actuality, rail crossing bars lower long before the train is visible. If this was a ten second race, that means the rail bars dropped 2-3 seconds before the train appeared.","Miscellaneous: When Brian spins his Eclipse out while testing it in the stadium parking lot. You can clearly see that the reverse lights are on while the car is spinning.

Also, the dashboard is not the Jetta's.","Factual errors: In the last scene when Dom and Brian drag race, the butterflies on the blower scoop close when he revs up the motor, when they would really open, since they are allow air to enter the blower.","Crew or equipment visible: When the racers are on their way to the first race, there is an aerial shot of above the street, and in the right side of the screen a lighting tower is visibly illuminating the street.","Revealing mistakes: When Dom and Brian first take the Supra out for a test drive they pull up to a Ferrari. The guy in the Ferrari is bald but within the race you can see a guy with hair driving it.","Miscellaneous: As Brian is driving up to the gathering before the first race, you can clearly see a hose hanging below his Eclipse. Afterwards, the hose is absent.","Crew or equipment visible: Just before the final race between Dom and Brian, as the view comes up to Dom, the camera, and camera man (wearing a red shirt) are reflected in the Charger's side-view mirror.","Continuity: In Letty's race at Race Wars, her seats change from black racing seats, to light gray stock seats, then back to racing seats","Continuity: After leaving the parking garage where he has hidden his car, Dominick is spotted by a single police car and followed/chased.

However, Brian then picks up Dom to evade the cops and Dom sits normally in the passenger seat. In actuality he would have nowhere to rest his feet and the hole in the floor would create a great deal of noise whilst driving.","Continuity: The Eclipse moves around between shots before being destroyed.","Continuity: Ted's shirt alternates between dry and oily between shots during the sequence at Tran's garage.","Continuity: When one of the bikers comes off the road, Toretto goes to look over the ridge at the him and we see a bandage on his nose, which is not there in previous or subsequent shots.","Continuity: Toward the end of the film when the three Civics are trying to highjack the truck, the rear spoiler of Dom's car changes style between shots.","Crew or equipment visible: When Dom is trying to rescue Vince from the truck, you can see a stuntman's arms driving the car in a few of the rear shots due to the long sleeve black shirt he is wearing compared to the short sleeve white shirt that Dom is wearing.","Continuity: Many of the cars have roll cages which change colors between shots.","Continuity: During the race wars, when Jesse is up against Johnny Tran, we see Johnny Tran pull up in his car next to him and he is clearly wearing a buttoned up black shirt.

After Hector introduces himself to Brian, he points across the alley to his car but we see the same Honda Accord that Brian is parked next to. You can tell by, 1) the headlights (Hector drives a mid-'90s model Civic hatchback which has more rounded headlights, but the car he point's to has rectangular Honda Accord headlights), and, 2) the design at the bottom of the windshield (both the car that Brian is standing next to and the car Hector points to have the same design, but later in the film, Hector drives to The Racer's Edge, and his Civic has nothing at the bottom of the windshield, also, note the headlights on the Civic and on the car he points to).","Revealing mistakes: In one aerial shot after the first race when the police are driving onto the street, you can see police cars waiting for their cues on the side streets. They have their parking lights on at first and then turn on their lights and light bars when they begin driving into the racer traffic.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Edwin is looking at Brian's car before the first race, he is heard to say, \"He's got enough NOS in there to blow himself up, period,\" but he appears to be saying something else.","Continuity: When Brian gets out of the car to check Tran after shooting him off his bike, he clearly slams the door of his Supra as he runs over to him, but when he returns to the car, the door is open.","Crew or equipment visible: When Mia notices that Brian has arrived at the party with Dominic, the cameraman's elbow can be seen in the mirror just before the shirt covers the camera.","Revealing mistakes: When Jesse puts the floppy disk in the A-Drive to show Brian the Supra designs, the computer power switch is clearly in the \"OFF\" position.","Continuity: When Dom hides his car in the empty building and begins walking down the sidewalk, the cop car that passes him is a Ford Crown Victoria. But when we see it again, it is a Chevrolet Caprice.","Continuity: When the officers are in the house and Brain pushes the detective. He is on the left side of the FBI agent. When they swap to show it from the other side, the agent falls past the FBI agent on his right side.","Continuity: After the window is pulled out at the beginning of the movie, the weather stripping is visible under the windshield wiper. In the next shot it is gone.","Revealing mistakes: After race wars, Brian returns to town and pulls his car into a driveway. His stuntman is clearly recognizable as the driver in this shot as his hairline is a good 2 or 3 inches further back than Paul Walker's.","Revealing mistakes: In the first race, all the cars pull up from left to right and Brian is last and misses the starting line. When he goes to back up, the car next to him pulls up again.","Miscellaneous: At the beginning, when Brian's Eclipse is first shown, as he is driving you can see he always hold the steering wheel with his right hand and is always shifting with his right hand.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: Back at Dom's house after the first race.

This can not happen since smoking tires means the loss of traction and a wheelstand means no loss of traction.","Continuity: After the first race, it is acknowledged that Brian's Eclipse has blown its piston rings and requires the engine taking apart for repair, also some other kind of damage must have occurred (the manifold, according to his in-car laptop) that caused the floor-pan to fall through. This however doesn't affect Brian being able to evade the police and escape at a reasonable speed immediately after.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: Whenever Brian is driving the eclipse after the police chase, you can hear the car shifting but Brian's hand remains on the steering wheel.","Factual errors: When Brian is testing the top speed of his Eclipse at the beginning of the film, he appears to have 7 forward gears. After seeing him shift into first before starting, you can count 6 more up-shifts after, either by seeing him change gear or by hearing it.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: In the scene where Brian asks Mia for the number of Dom's cellphone to trace him, we can clearly hear the sound of a \"clamshell phone\" being closed, right after she gives the number to the Nextel operator. But in the next shot, Brian took the phone and continues the call.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: Close-up shot of Charger's engine throttle, the sound of the engine revs up and down doesn't match the throttle positions.","Factual errors: In the last race between Dom and Brian, Dom is heard/seen shifting 7 or 8 times.","Continuity: The windshield wipers are randomly on, when the Supra is jumping the tracks in the last race.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: At the first party, what the \"guitar guy\" is playing doesn't match the resulting sound(s).","Plot holes: Towards the end of the film, when Brian and Mia are trying to stop Dom and co from robbing the armed trucker, Mia gives the Nextel operator Dom's cell number over Brian's cell phone. Since both Brian and Dom have active cell phones, why didn't they use one of them to call one of their friends when the Tran brothers blew up Brian's car after the first race?","Continuity: When the police car speeds past Dom when he is walking down the street, it is a Crown Voictoria. When the car turns around, it is a Chevy Caprice.","Continuity: During the last truck scene, during a close up of the Supra from the rear, the Toyota symbol is upside down. Any other shot of the logo throughout the movie shows it as normal.","Factual errors: Right after the first race when Brian loses his car, Dom says \"Granny shiftin' and not double clutching like you should.\" Double clutching takes precious time to do, time that you do not have during a drag race especially in a Mitsubishi Eclipse. The only time to double clutch that car would be in a road course race to save the brakes coming in fast into a corner.","Factual errors: Through out the Movie, characters are seen using \"NOS\" towards the end of the race when in reality, nitrous oxide is used from the very beginning of the race."],"tt0031680":[],"tt0087004":["Continuity: After sitting on the steps listening to the cop, The Brother walks away leaving the cop sitting there.

When Finn chases after her and gets into the taxi, his feet are clean.","Continuity: When Finn is yelling up at Estella's apartment after his show, his bottle of wine switches hands from the left to the right and then back to the left.","Errors in geography: When Arthur Lustig visits Finn, Finn gives him his address as 111 Greenwhich St., which is south of the World Trade Center. The nearest subway stop is the Rector St. 1/9 train. Yet when Finn takes Arthur to the subway, they end up at the J/M/Z Chambers St. stop. When a subway train does come, miraculously it is the G train, which is the only train in the system that does not enter Manhattan at all. In addition, none of the above mentioned trains would take Arthur to JFK, his stated destination, without at least one transfer.","Factual errors: In the scene in which Lustig is shown on TV, the commentator mentions Lustig is due for death by lethal injection. Florida only began offering lethal injection relatively recently. When Finn was a boy, the method would have been the electric chair."],"tt0025911":[],"tt0075029":["Crew or equipment visible: During the rape scene, crew members can be seen through the legs of a bandit.","Anachronisms: The use of metallic cartridge conversion revolvers that did not exist until well after the war. The pistol that Wales retrieved from the ruins of his house was not offered until 1871. Other conversion guns also pop up throughout the film.","Continuity: During his showdown with the Comancheros, the sun is behind everyone, no matter which way they're facing.","Anachronisms: Towards the end of the film, Josey and Laura Lee exchange jokes about their respective home states. Laura Lee tells a gag about Missouri being the \"show-me\" state, a nickname which most people agree only dates back to the 1890s, whereas this film is set in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, in the 1860s.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Laura Lee plays the concertina, the sound doesn't match what she's playing.","Anachronisms: The hymn \"In the Sweet By and By\" wasn't published until 1867.","Crew or equipment visible: Near the end of the film when Wales is fighting the posse outside the house, you can see the legs of a C-stand when a man from Terrill's gang falls off a horse.","Miscellaneous: The cart has a square hole that the crew uses to drive the cart instead of Granny and the girl. It is obviously driving the cart not the women. It also disappears and reappears.","Factual errors: A Gatling gun holds either 20 or 50 rounds, but Josey fires way more, not to mention the soldiers before him.","Continuity: When the Redleg leader is shooting at the Gatling gun, he fires 4 shots. When he runs over to the Gatling gun tent and points his gun in it, you can see all six lead balls sticking out of the front of the cylinder.","Continuity: After the bounty hunters are killed by Josey and Terrill, he spits on the forehead on one of the dead men who's eyes are closed, then it shows him again as they ride away and the dead man's eyes are open.","Crew or equipment visible: Camera shadow on Ten Bear's horse as he rides out of the camp to meet Josey.","Crew or equipment visible: Near the end, after the old lady comments about freeloaders from Kansas, a camera shadow is seen when a guy falls off his horse in the last shoot out.","Continuity: When Josey frees Laura Lee and Granny from Commancheros he cuts the ropes binding their hands and you can see Laura Lee's wrists have rope burns from being pulled along.

It is unlikely at that time that anyone but the army had them.","Revealing mistakes: After Josey and an injured Jamie are confronted by a pair of hunters who happen upon them, a gunfight ensues, leaving their would-be captors dead on the ground. To demonstrate his contempt for them, Josey spits chewing tobacco onto the forehead of one of the now dead men. The now thoroughly dead gunman flinches slightly as the tobacco hits him.","Errors in geography: When Josie goes to the cabin of Lone Watie there are black tail deer antlers on the wall. These deer live on the West Coast, not in the area of Missouri or surrounding area.","Anachronisms: The fiddle that provided the music for dancing at the ranch was fitted with a chin-piece, which was not used until the twentieth century.","Anachronisms: The Gatling guns shown during the massacre of the surrendering confederates are not Civil War period versions of that weapon. The Model 1861 Gatling was a .58 caliber weapon firing from individually loaded brass or steel chambers which were fed into the receiver via a hopper or chute attached to the side of the gun's housing. As a result, the gun's rate of fire was significantly slower than is shown in in the film. The guns shown in the movie were models of 1867 or later, which were chambered for fixed ammunition, usually 45/70 and fed through a stick magazine on the top of the weapon's receiver.","Anachronisms: At one point in the movie there is a soldier playing a 5 string open-back banjo claw-hammer style in the back-ground. Shadows through the leather head of the banjo can be seen. Even though the banjo started to evolve in the late 1840s, the open-back banjo was invented by Arthur Windsor in England after 1887 and \"frailing\" (claw-hammer style picking) did not become popular until the late 1800s'.","Continuity: In the scene where Josie has bought supplies, he is recognized and a gunfight ensues.

However, a few moments later, as Josie escapes on horseback, the same Union soldiers he just killed are seen rushing into the street to stare after him.","Anachronisms: Laura Lee tells Josey a joke about two men and a mule and quotes the saying \"I'm from Missouri, show me\". William VanDiver's speech that coined the phrase wasn't given until 1899, over thirty years after the time the film takes place.","Revealing mistakes: After Josey shoots the two men in the cabin/store where he goes to get a horse, he spits tobacco juice on one man's head and the dead man's eyes squint in reaction.","Plot holes: After Josey rescues Little Moonlight, she tells him and Lone Watie what happened to her, in her language. Lone Watie translates for Josey. As soon as he stops talking, Little Moonlight continues her story, but, if she doesn't speak English, how did she know Lone Watie was done translating? She didn't give him a chance to say anything else.","Continuity: When Fletcher tells Terrill to say which way they're going so that the bounty hunters will hear the wrong information, Terrill looks back over his right shoulder to see the bounty hunters. But when the troops ride away, as seen from a different angle, the bounty hunters are more to Terrill's left.","Continuity: When Josey Wales is leaving the interior of the store carrying the supplies, he is also carrying the picture postcard of the dead man that the store clerk showed him.

Earlier kings were addressed as \"Your Grace.\"","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: It has been said that the size of Robin's childhood hand mark on the carved stone when we see Robin's memory fits the size of his hand as an adult. However, Robin places his hand in the hand mark of his father which fits.","Anachronisms: The white horse where Robin and the barons meet to defeat the French is one of the many newer white horse hillside carvings in Britain. Only the Uffington White Horse has existed since the Bronze Age and looks much more abstract than the one in the film, the others have all been created in the past 300 years, most of them even in the 19th century.","Continuity: Near the beginning of the movie when Marian is helping the men plow the field, a thunderstorm is approaching behind her (as evidenced by the dark clouds and thunder). Yet a few minutes later when the sheriff begins harassing her, we only see puffy white clouds and blue sky.","Plot holes: In the beginning of the movie, an army of 3000+ men is left to pillage and plunder in France after Richard dies; nothing is ever made mention again of these men in the movie. Yet the French are able to raise an army to invade England while leaving this other British army behind on French land. Where did this French army come from to be able to invade England?","Revealing mistakes: In the establishing shot of King Richard's campsite in France, a burnt village can clearly be seen on the right side of the frame, yet it isn't mentioned. Later in the movie, we see the same exact village, but this time it's in England, and is named Barnsdale, where Robin is from. The village is unharmed, but soon it's burned by Godfrey and his men, revealing to us that it's the same set from the one in France.","Continuity: When Robin first discovers the inscription on the sword hilt in the boat, the inscription reads from the base of the blade to the pommel. But when he re-reads the inscription by the fireplace on his first night in Nottingham, it reads from the pommel to the base of the blade.","Factual errors: King Richard is shown dying in France during a siege of a castle due to a lucky crossbow shot. This is correct. However, the movie states that this occurred as Richard was on his way home from the Third Crusade circa 1193. In reality, Richard's ship was grounded on the coast of Croatia in 1193, and he and a few knights made their way to Vienna, where Richard was taken prisoner by the Holy Roman Empire. Richard's death was in 1198.","Anachronisms: Many of the helmets used by Richard and his knights were of a style 200 years in the future from when the movie was set.","Factual errors: The Sheriff taunts Lady Marian by saying that her husband, Robin of Loxley, has been gone for 10 years. In reality, the armies of the Third Crusade left for the Middle East around 1189, and the last of the survivors had returned home by 1194 - a span of five years.","Anachronisms: Modern World War II landing craft were used by the French at the landing of England. Amphibious landing craft were not invented or used until World War II.","Anachronisms: When Godfrey meets a Frenchman outside of a sleeping camp, he whistles and is answered with the the song Frere Jacques. The earliest known version of this song is from 1775, well after this movie was supposed to take place.","Anachronisms: Cremation, as done to Sir Walter Loxley, was frowned upon by the church and therefore was forbidden in parts of medieval Europe (mostly those where the church had a strong influence, England being such a place) other than in the case of mass cremations for disease and as a punishment for heretics.","Errors in geography: Robin and the troops arriving from Nottingham meet up with William Marshal and his troops at the White Horse. The one in Uffington was the only one in existence at that time. Uffington is Northwest of London, approximately 160 miles (by modern driving routes) from Dungeness, where the French troops are landing. It's impossible that they would have arrived in the time depicted.","Errors in geography: At the meeting in Barnsdale, William Marshal informs King John and the Barons that the French are \"in the channel\". Then, after the battle at Nottingham, the French officer informs Robin that the French will land in two days. (aside from him having no way to know this since the message to Philip to invade had just been dispatched by Godfrey when they marched on Nottingham). The channel crossing from Calais to Dungeness is only about 25 miles and would not take two days.","Errors in geography: In the Director's cut of the film on DVD, the French land in \"Dungeness\" (in the theatrical version it is never identified by name). Dungeness is a flat marshy area with no cliffs as depicted in the film. The area looks more like Dover, which would have been a more likely choice to invade since it is somewhat closer to France than Dungeness, although not considerably so.","Factual errors: The actual Isabella of Angoulême, was not the niece of King Philip of France. She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême, and 12 years old at the time of her marriage to King John. Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan, son of the then Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued. Unlike in the film, Eleanor of Aquitaine readily accepted her as John's wife. Ironically, after John's death, she married Hugh X of Lusignan, the son of her original fiancé.","Continuity: In the beginning as Robin approaches the ambush scene he is seen running with his bow in hand, arrow at the ready. As the camera switches away then back he is seen taking his bow off his back."],"tt0024416":[],"tt0047230":["Continuity: The number of the carrier changes during landing operations from 34 to 43 from time to time in the movie. It is visible during take-offs and landings.","Continuity: In some of actual war scenes where rockets are supposedly being fired by the jets, they are actually being fired by Corsairs (propeller aircraft).","Continuity: The number of the carrier changes depending on the scene. Sometimes the jets take off from the carrier Oriskany, CV-34, and sometimes from Antietam, CV-36. Also, when Commander Grayson is brought back from the water by helicopter, the number on the \"island\" on the background is for the Princeton, CV-37.","Continuity: When the squadron leader ejects early in the movie, the scene switches to a slow motion shot of an actual ejection. The plane is all silver and most definitely not a black F9F Navy Panther jet."],"tt0079473":[],"tt0018742":["Continuity: During the Yankee Stadium sequence, an elevated train goes by in the background in one shot, but disappears before leaving the frame in the next shot.","Continuity: When Buster breaks the glass in the door for the first time, the remaining pieces change in between shots.","Continuity: As Buster goes to the newsreel office for the first time, we can see the same girl leaving the building in consecutive shots.","Revealing mistakes: Right before the last time the glass in the door is broken (when the wind shuts it abruptly), it is possible to see that it's already cracked to ensure that it will break when the door slams.","Revealing mistakes: Near the end, when Sally and her Boss are watching the part of the tape filmed by the monkey, the shots of Luke bringing Sally to land change, as if the monkey had moved the camera. There's also some movement to fit the characters better, which couldn't be managed by an animal."],"tt0105417":["Continuity: The crystal glass on Mother Superior's desk when she meets Deloris.","Crew or equipment visible: Crew visible in patrol car door window as it is opened outside the casino in Reno.","Continuity: During one song, Mary Robert is praying with her hands in the praying position. In the very next shot, her hands are instantly by her side.","Continuity: During the singing act at the beginning of the movie, wireless microphone colors keep rotating between the three singers.","Crew or equipment visible: When Sister Mary Clarence/Dolores is meeting with the Mother Superior in her office right after the first choir performance in which she is choir mistress a crewmember's hand can be seen trying to get the pigeons to stay on the window sill.","Miscellaneous: Toward the end of the film, as the nuns are looking out of the airplane window at Reno, it is quite obvious that they are merely looking at a string of Christmas lights.","Factual errors: When Delores was singing in the nightclub she had two back-up singers, but the back-up chords had three notes. Delores was singing the solo, so that would be impossible.","Revealing mistakes: When Sister Mary Clarence/Dolores is escaping from Joey and Willy, towards the end of the film, she is shot at. We hear the shot but, although the pistol is on screen at the same time, we don't see it being fired.","Continuity: When Sister Mary Roberts gives Sister Mary Clarence the clock to help her wake up in the morning, you see Sister Mary Clarence's hand reach out for clock. In the next shot, Mary Clarence's hand reaches out for the clock again.","Continuity: During \"Pope\" performance, stage medium shots reveal microphone stands stage left and stage right to the choir. During wide shots, the microphone stands disappear.","Continuity: During the credits at the end of the movie, the spelling of Deloris's name rotates between Delores and Deloris on the magazine covers. The first two magazines (People and Newsweek) show \"Delores,\" while the second two, Time and the National Enquirer show \"Deloris\".","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the first scene, young Delores' teacher asks her to write the names of all the apostles on the blackboard, alphabetically. Delores writes \"John, Paul, Peter, Elvis.\" Until she writes \"Elvis\" the teacher is nodding in approval. Two things are wrong with this. First, Paul (though considered an apostle in a different context) is not one of the original twelve apostles. Second, when the apostles are written alphabetically, \"Andrew\" is the first. Any Catholic school teacher would have corrected her long before she added \"Elvis\" to the list.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Sister Mary Clarence is running through the kitchen to escape from Joey and Willy, they shoot at her as she starts up the stairs. Approximately one second elapses between the shot and the ricochet off the stair railing. In reality, at the distance the shot was fired, the ricochet would have been almost instantaneous.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: In the final song you can string instruments, but there is only a piano on the stage.","Factual errors: Near the end of the movie, in the scene where the nuns are searching around the casino, one of the sisters goes to a black jack table and says \"Has anyone seen a nun, a Carmelite nun?\" This is an error because Carmelite nuns have different habits then the ones shown in the film.","Plot holes: SPOILER: The story revolves around the idea that Deloris saw Vince LaRocca kill someone and can therefore testify against him in court, so Vince must do away with her or go to prison. Yet, in the casino, he is prepared to kill her in full view of all the nuns. This means that he would then have to kill all of the sisters since they could now testify against him for killing Deloris.","Plot holes: SPOILER: The chauffeur has already been shot when Delores enters Vince's office; it is assumed that she sees the dead body, or perhaps hears the actual shot being fired as she enters the room. Either way, she is not in the office in time to hear the conversation she later relates to Ltnt. Souther. For that matter, we see/hear Vince talking to the chauffeur before he is shot by a henchman with the silenced pistol. At no time does Vince say anything along the lines of what Delores later repeats to the police."],"tt0031421":[],"tt0040427":["Revealing mistakes: When running through the sewers, electric cords powering the the flashlights are visible","Continuity: After examining the bullet casings, Lee tells Capt. Breen that the same gun was used to shoot Officer Rawlins and Detective Jones. But Roy actually used a revolver to kill Rawlins and a .45 automatic to shoot Jones.","Continuity: A revolver ejects its spent casings only if the shooter does so manually, which Richard Baseheart didn't do, therefore the police could not have even had them to compare with the fired casings from the automatic. An even bigger blunder was the photo comparing the two fired shells, they were clearly marked .380 auto, an entirely different round than the .38 special or .45 auto that the police claimed were fired from the same gun. So now there were three different guns used to create this technical error.","Continuity: When Roy Martin confronts Reeves in Reeves' bedroom, Martin's shadow changes position depending upon whether the shot is from behind Reeves or from a closer position.","Continuity: When Martin flees from his bungalow into the sewer system, the first shot shows him running in the sewer with a torch and a bag in his hand. This is the same shot as used earlier on in the film after he started robbing liquor stores. (In this later scene, he did not have a bag when he fled the bungalow nor when he entered the sewers.)"],"tt0054237":[],"tt0424971":[],"tt0035679":[],"tt0018876":["Continuity: After being rejected by Louisa, Farmer Sweetland's horse changes position in between shots as he mounts it.","Continuity: When Farmer Sweetland and Minta are embracing, Sweetland's hands are all the way around her in one shot then just on her arm in the next shot."],"tt0029486":[],"tt0022418":[],"tt0054924":[],"tt0039859":[],"tt0048863":[],"tt0808331":["Revealing mistakes: When Brad tries to seduce Abby in their bedroom, the peak meter of the baby monitor indicates that Lily is still screaming on top of her lungs, when she is actually sleeping peacefully.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The video tape Joshua pulls from the drawer to watch is dated 2/29/1997. 1997 was not a leap year."],"tt0055294":["Factual errors: When the astronauts go out of their spaceship to make a repair, they are untethered by any restraint and freely walk on the spacecraft's wing, in defiance of the laws of physics.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Capt.

He then gives his reply. Later, when she is playing the tape over the air, his same reply is missing a word or two from his original taped reply.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In closed Union cities like New York, radio talent would not mix their own audio (as during the call-in); this would be done by an audio engineer/production specialist.","Continuity: In the scene where Detective Mercer is the bar room with his ex-wife, the amount of liquid in the detective's glass goes from full to nearly empty back to half-full multiple times throughout the sequence.","Continuity: The first time Erica goes to the Police Station and is asked to wait she is wearing a white T-Shirt under her hoody sweatshirt. When she walks out of the Police Station and into the Gun Shop, the white T-Shirt is now a red T-Shirt.","Continuity: When Erica goes into the bathroom of the bar to refresh herself, she wets her hair and head, leaving her hair dripping wet.

At that point you see his gun and extra magazine on the same side of his body. No trained police officer, especially a detective, would have both his weapon and extra magazine on the same side of his body (unless the magazine pouch is situated in a way for the opposing hand to draw the magazine, such as in a horizontal magazine pouch) because it would take too long for him to swap the weapon into the other hand then reach around to grab his extra magazine. The proper way would be to have his magazine on the opposite side of his body than where his gun is drawn from the holster.","Factual errors: SPOILER: When Erica pulls her gun on the pimp, we hear a gun-cocking sound. However, Kahr Arms pistols have no exposed hammer and therefore can't be hand-cocked.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Erica shoots the last thug, he is face up with a blood splatter pattern behind his head; however, the zoom out of the same scene shows him face down (to the left) with a blood splatter pattern to the right of his head.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Mercer plants the gun in the dead thug's hand his fingers clearly move to grasp it."],"tt0062724":[],"tt0009611":["Continuity: Charlie, disguised as a tree, enters a pipe to escape a German.

In fact, plastic hulled shotgun shells did not come around until Remington introduced them in 1960.

The scene of Catherine & Lizzie observing and commenting on the manners of Mr. Collins is simultaneous with the Collins/Darcy scene therefore it is impossible for Mary to be also heard singing at this time from another room into which Lizzie then walks.

The scene has been filmed as a continuous shot but it is impossible for the Sun to have moved. In the commentary the director explains that the scene was cut as Lizzie passes behind some laundry - not \"to indicate a passing of time\" - but because he wanted to use the Sun from both sides of the house.

While an eV is a unit of energy, it is a very small one. One trillion eV would be enough energy to power a 100 Watt lightbulb for slightly over one million-millionth of a second (1.6 pSec to be more precise). Dr. Martin (as a nuclear scientist) would have known this was a small amount of energy, so it can't be put off as the alien misusing unfamiliar terms.","Plot holes: After the FBI agent regains consciousness on the ground, you can see the piece of paper, containing top-secret information that Dr. Martin was supposed to leave under the rock, next to the FBI agent. When the FBI agent gets up he leaves the piece of paper on the ground, goes to his car, answers the radio, and then leaves without going back to get the piece of paper.","Revealing mistakes: The microphone used to record Dr. Martin's confession is a desktop shortwave radio pushbutton microphone. When the button is up, it acts as a speaker. You have to depress the \"talk\" button on the base in order to transmit. The FBI agent just holds the neck of the mike stand without depressing the \"talk\" button.

But shortly after the failed execution the prison is shown covered in snow.","Errors in geography: In one of the earlier episodes of Season 1, there is a scene of an overhead view of traffic along a busy road supposedly in Illinois, but the cars are traveling up on the left side of the road which means that this scene was not shot in the United States.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: SPOILER: In a season two flashback, Michael remembers when he once visited Lincoln in prison. He says Lincoln had killed the President's brother, but at the time when Lincoln was charged with the murder of Terrence Stedman, he was only the VICE-president's brother, as mentioned on many occasions in the first season. The VP was only promoted to President much later on in the series. This may have been to prevent confusing people who had not seen the first season.

This was a conscious decision of director Merian C. Cooper [/name/nm0178260/], who felt that Kong's size wasn't impressive enough in New York. The publicity materials would later state Kong's height was 60 feet, almost 3 times the average height as he is actually depicted in the film.","Revealing mistakes: A Skull Island resident jumps from a hut and falls beside a domed chicken cage, which then hinges backwards and catches the actor's wig, taking it off his head, and remaining on top of the cage.","Continuity: When Kong escapes from his bonds in the theater in New York, he leaves the right cuff of his shackles on his wrist. During the subsequent rampage through the city, the cuff is missing in several scattered shots, and in the entirety of the sequence in which Kong destroys the elevated train. That sequence was reportedly conceived, designed, and filmed when the picture came from the editing room at thirteen reels in length, to which producer-director Merian C. Cooper [/name/nm0178260/] objected superstitiously. It is easy to see how the cuff would be forgotten in such a situation, but the other disappearances remain a mystery.","Revealing mistakes: When Kong puts Ann on the tree throne (just before the T-Rex encounter), she moves a meter or so to the left as stop-motion gives way to live-action. Also, because of the full-size tree and actress matted over a portion of the miniature jungle set, part of Kong's paw disappears, seemingly behind the tree but, in fact, behind the matted-in live-action at this moment.","Revealing mistakes: When Kong is looking at Ann when she is tied to the sacrificial altar, the pillars of the model altar cast shadows on his chest, but there is no shadow of Ann between them.","Continuity: The first Skull Island native that Kong bites after he breaks through the wall changes orientation between the long shot of him being picked up and the close-up in Kong's mouth. The head changes direction between shots.","Crew or equipment visible: When Kong takes Ann to the edge of the cliff on Skull Island, the animation stand is visible for one frame, left in the shot for a single frame by the technical artists.","Revealing mistakes: In the middle of Kong's battle with the T-Rex, the tree on which Ann Darrow sits falls to the ground. While this occurs, the stop-motion animation of the two fighting monsters ceases completely and visibly before the end of the wide shot of the falling tree.","Continuity: When Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, the second person falls and land at the bottom of the chasm, but when the camera cuts back, he appears to be back on the log.","Continuity: The head of the full size Kong is more elongated than the close-up head.","Continuity: In close-ups of his face, King Kong has more teeth than he does when his whole body is shown.","Continuity: When Kong is fighting the miniature biplanes the length of the lower wings are the same as the upper. When actual footage of biplanes are used the lower wingspans are shorter than the upper.","Continuity: When Kong tears Ann's dress, he leaves her left shoulder completely bare. After this, there is a string-like strap over it in all shots of her in the rest of the jungle sequence.","Revealing mistakes: As Kong puts Ann down atop the Empire State Building, a matte shot of the live actress replaces the animated model of Ann in Kong's paw, but the matte plainly cuts off a large corner of the shadow thrown by the paw on the building. The same error happens again a few minutes later.","Revealing mistakes: Kong's fur seems to ripple as he moves, this is due to the indentations made in the fur of the Kong model by the fingers of the men who were constantly touching it to change its position slightly to produce the stop-motion animation effects.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: \"The natives built the wall on Skull Island to protect themselves from King Kong, yet put a pair of doors on it big enough for him to come through.\" This is a common misconception. Since Kong can climb the Empire State Building, he probably gets into the compound occasionally; the size of the gate allows the villagers to send him back out.","Continuity: When the car crashes into the front entrance of the hotel it doesn't have any glass in the windshield area. In the next shot, it has a windshield, but with a hole broken into it.","Continuity: In the scene where Kong shakes some of the men off a log, when the men first run across the log, 4 of them make it all the way across, but when Kong confronts them, they are all back on the log.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: During the show in New York, Carl Denham refers to Jack Driscoll as \"John Driscoll.\" This is not incorrect, however, as Jack was once commonly used as a diminutive name for men named John.","Errors in geography: When Kong is on the Empire State Building, even though it is supposed to be morning, rays of sunlight are poking through the clouds from the west, on the New Jersey side of Manhattan, an impossibility at that time of day.","Errors in geography: In the wide shot of Kong climbing the Empire State Building, he is climbing the western face of the structure. The financial district is visible to the south in the background. The shot of him atop the tower shows the Chrysler Building directly behind him. That building being to the ESB's north east, that puts Kong on the southern face of the building. When he falls, in the closer shot, he falls back to the south east. Back in the wide shot, he falls off the western side.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Fifteen men chase Kong through the forest. At the end of the pursuit, only Driscoll and Denham are leftover. Nevertheless, when Denham speaks to the audience, he tells them \"twelve of our party met horrible deaths\". Thus, one man disappears. The explanation: A deleted sequence between the encounters with the brontosaurus in the swampy lake and Kong at the fallen-tree bridge across the ravine. In it, the survivors of the first incident meet three triceratops, and undoubtedly the other \"horrible death\" occurred here.

However, in the next part of the scene his hand is cut up.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: After meeting Mini-Mi, Fat Bastard sings the Chili's baby back ribs song. The first Chili's restaurant didn't open until 1975, thus Fat Bastard should not know the song. However, Dr. Evil has time travel technology, so Fat Bastard could have gone forward in time prior to the events of the movie and discovered the restaurant.","Errors in geography: Just before Burt Bacharach [/name/nm0000820/] and Elvis Costello [/name/nm0004845/] sing, the camera pans. You can clearly see the mountains of LA/California in the background, although the scene is set in London.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Elvis Costello [/name/nm0004845/] appears as an adult in a scene set in 1969, but he was only fifteen years old that year. However, both the good and bad sides have access to time travel, so the modern-day Costello probably came back in time to perform for Austin.","Revealing mistakes: In the lab scene, whilst analysing Fat Bastard's stool sample, the Union Flag on Austin's Coffee Mug is upside down.","Revealing mistakes: (at 02:56) The US President is seen looking through a screen which has numerous black flakes of dirt on it.","Crew or equipment visible: When Mini Me puts Mini Mr. Bigglesworth under the table, he is obviously handing the cat to a crew member under the table instead of just dropping him on the floor.","Factual errors: In the darkroom, Austin makes 8X10's of the pictures he took earlier. However, the door is left open, so the light coming from outside would totally ruin the photos.

Yet in other shots nothing happens as he walks around.","Plot holes: As Mini-Me tried to kill Scott Evil by pressing the red button on the control panel, Mini-Me's name already appears as one of the other four choices. About a minute ago, Dr. Evil didn't even know he had a miniature clone of himself, and this clone has not yet been named by anyone.","Anachronisms: In the 1969 era scene with the President, there is a US Army 4 star general wearing the dress green uniform. The actor is wearing a light green shirt. The US Army wore khaki shirts with the dress green uniforms until 1983 when they changed to the current light green shirt.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Number Two states that Mini-me is one-eighth of Dr. Evil's size. Since Dr. Evil is less than six feet tall, that would mean Mini-me, if he was 1/8 the size of Dr. Evil, would be 1/8 of six feet, or about nine inches tall (72/8). Since Mini-me is clearly about two feet tall, it would have been factual to refer to Mini-me as one-third the size of Dr. Evil. If Mini-me was 1/8 the size of Dr. Evil, that would mean that Dr. Evil is sixteen feet tall.","Anachronisms: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me [/title/tt0145660/] (1999) supposedly took place right after where Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery [/title/tt0118655/] (1997) left off in 1997, yet all references to the present label the year as 1999.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When Austin is fighting Mustafa, a European \"cow crossing\" sign can be seen along the roadside. This is part of the \"England, Southern California\" gag which acknowledges that the filming location does not match the story setting.","Plot holes: Since the series specializes in spoofing the real history of the \"past\" that they travel to, the 1969 President should be a caricature of Richard Nixon [/name/nm0633271/]. Yet there is no clue that this is supposed to be Nixon.","Factual errors: The President says that such a sum of money (one hundred billion dollars) doesn't even exist in 1969. In fact, total US government expenditures in 1969 amounted 279.7 billions dollars.","Continuity: SPOILER: Before Vanessa explodes, Austin Powers is not wearing a necklace. After Vanessa explodes he is wearing a diamond necklace.","Anachronisms: SPOILER: A modern radio tower is visible in the distance before Mustafa falls off the cliff.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Austin runs in to save Felicity Shagwell, as her runs through the door it is obvious Dr. Evil is a double.","Continuity: SPOILER: After Felicity kicks Fat Bastard in the groin at the end, she pushes the button to start a party. However, his body is gone when Austin steps down from the bed.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Austin and Robin Spitz Swallows are in the nightclub, Robin is hit in the back by the would-be assassin's knife. In the very next frame, the knife is gone, but then reappears in subsequent shots.","Continuity: SPOILER: Austin hides behind the bar while Vanessa shoots at him, but after she explodes he is in front of the bar.","Factual errors: SPOILER: When Felicity is in the tube, being gassed to death, it is supposedly monitoring her heart rate, but there is no equipment of any kind attached to her, making this impossible.","Continuity: SPOILER: When the camera zooms in on Vanessa doing Dr. Evil's trademark hand gesture, her eyes show zeroes, but in the next shot, they count down from 2.","Continuity: SPOILER: Robin Spitz Swallows is shot in the back several times with a machine gun causing holes to be put in her coat she is wearing. When they fall out of the window, the holes cannot be seen on her back as they once were the last shot.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Austin's mojo is thrown into the air in the Moon-base, it is a glass cylinder with liquid and a red solid inside it. When it smashes on the floor there is a small puddle but no solid.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: SPOILER: Deliberate plot hole/continuity error by the filmmakers. The idea that Vanessa is a fembot, contradicts many plot points of Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery [/title/tt0118655/] (1997). This is a spoof of improbable twists in many other movies. It's meant to shock and entertain, for the very reason that it makes no sense.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: After Felicity Shagwell shoots out Mustafa's tire, you can see that the tire is fully inflated as it drives off the cliff."],"tt0093141":[],"tt0439799":[],"tt1422757":[],"tt0079020":["Continuity: The rifles Sebastian and his friends take from the gallery are of lever-action design, in the following gun-fight in the cactus fields they unmistakably use single-shot bolt-action rifles."],"tt0031495":[],"tt0050299":[],"tt0108171":["Continuity: After Miller misses El Cirujano and the Indians are fired on, Cacique is squatting down over the one who was killed.

You can see at the top of the screen the feet of the two men who moments before had come down from the rocks to move the body, still up on top of the rocks.","Continuity: When Beckett is using the sleeping Miller as bait, the knife that is seen bobbing in the water is different than the one Beckett later removes. The one that distracts the enemy sniper is a cheap \"survival\" knife, while the one Beckett is seen untying is a Marine Corps fighting knife, or \"Ka-Bar\".","Continuity: The camouflage paint on Millers face changes continuously throughout the movie.","Errors in geography: When Beckett and Miller are getting on the train, the Queensland Rail symbol, QR, is clearly visible on the side of the carriages.","Continuity: In the opening scene, Beckett's spotter places the range as 650 meters.

However, the crew chief of the helicopter that extracts him in the opening scenes calls him \"Gunny\". The term \"Gunny\" is used as a familiarity with Gunnery Sergeants only, and a Master Gunnery Sergeant would NEVER be addressed as such. The closest appropriate term for a Master Gunnery Sergeant would be \"Master Guns\".","Continuity: After Beckett's spotter gets shot by an enemy sniper in the beginning, the blood on his chin appears, disappears, and finally appears again.","Continuity: When Miller loses his balance, slides down the slope and into the water, the overhead shot clearly shows the rifle dipping into the water. When the shot then moves to being in the water with Miller, he's holding the rifle above his head, keeping it dry and protected.","Factual errors: When Miller is firing his weapon at his shadow at the church and the weapon runs out of ammo you can hear numerous clicks of the firing pin as he pulls the trigger. With the model of weapon he carries once it is empty the weapon will not dry fire.","Factual errors: Beckett refers to catching steelhead in a river outside Livingston, Montana.

Soon after that, Lizzie mentions to Cornelia that she has forgotten her nightclothes, among other things, in her room and has to go get them. When she opens the door to leave the room, the chair that Cornelia had put there is gone.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): At the beginning, Lizzie explains to Cornelia that the staff were hearing noises and were threatening to quit. When Cornelia is playing cards a little later, Lizzie explains the same thing and Cornelia acts as though she had no idea as to why the staff quit."],"tt0101921":["Continuity: When Evelyn arrives in Whistle Stop, Ninny is sitting on a suitcase. A few minutes later, when they walk towards the car, the suitcase has disappeared.","Continuity: Evelyn's hands on the steering wheel when she is in the grocery store parking lot, getting ready to hit the \"young girls\" red Volkswagen.","Continuity: Beer disappears from Ruth's hand between shots during baseball game","Continuity: When Idgie, Big George, and a third man go to get Ruth so that she can leave her husband, they all arrive in one car, but when they leave Big George isn't in the car.","Continuity: Evelyn's pearls when she goes to the hospital to visit Ninny.","Continuity: Ed says the Evelyn has hit the younger girls car 6 times, but in the film she only hits it 4 times.","Continuity: When Buddy hangs up the swinging rope off of the bridge before entering the house, he hangs it on a post on the right side of the bridge. However, when he goes to retrieve Ruth's hat later, he grabs the rope from the left side of the bridge.","Continuity: When Ninnie is voicing the story of Ruth's cancer, she states that Ruth is moved to the Threadgoode house and placed downstairs. The following scenes indicate that Ruth is in an upstairs bedroom, as we see Idgie looking out the window, and looking down at the kids playing ball, and we see the tops of trees when Sipsey prepares the medications.","Continuity: Evelyn pauses with the wrapped fried green tomatoes in hand and looks down the hallway. There are several people in the hallway, one is an older woman with an orange flowered robe and a bandaged left foot. She is seated facing Evelyn as she begins her walk down the hallway, but as Evelyn passes the seated woman she suddenly has her back to the wall.","Continuity: At the sister's wedding, little Idgie climbs the tree; she throws her second shoe down twice.","Factual errors: In the scene where the young women are in the boxcar (from which they pass out canned goods), the box cars were obviously built by the set decorators. And wrong. The cars have outside bracing, common enough in the period of the film. But all outside-braced boxcars had their wood planks running horizontally, not vertically as in the movie.","Revealing mistakes: When Frank Bennett's truck is retrieved from the river, as it's being hoisted up and spins, it is obvious that the engine/transmission have been removed, and a painted piece of sheet-metal put in place to obscure the void.","Continuity: When Evelyn picks up the note from Idgy to Ruth at the end of the film, she does not place the note back on her grave beside the honey. But when it flashes back to the grave the note has been placed back on Ruth's grave stone.","Continuity: When Idgie is talking to Buddy in the tree, Mama comes out onto the porch, but a few moments into the conversation, we see her come outside again.","Revealing mistakes: As Idgie gets the honey and puts it in a jar for Ruth you see her wipe off the outside of the jar with the honeycomb inside. However, when she hands the jar to Ruth there is no honeycomb inside the jar.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the beginning of the movie when Ed and Evelyn are lost at the Whistle Stop searching for their Aunt Vesta's retirement home and are looking on the map, Ed mistakenly calls Evelyn \"Ruth\".","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the beginning of the movie when Mrs. Threadgood is talking to Evelin she says that Idge is arrested. But it turns out that she does not get convicted of murder like Mrs. Threadgood says she does.","Revealing mistakes: When Evelyn's husband brings her flowers, she pulls out previous flowers from the vase and we can see there is no water in the vase. Both bunch of flowers appear to be artificial.","Continuity: During one of Evelyn's visits to Ninny, Ninny is sporting a new hair-do. Her hair has been cut quite short and colored lavender. However, the next time Evelyn visits Ninny, her hair is once again very long and very white.","Factual errors: SPOILER: If Frank Bennett was murdered in Whistle Stop Alabama, then the murder trial would have to have taken place in Alabama, not Georgia. The state of Georgia would have no jurisdiction whatsoever on any crime committed in another state. A Georgia sheriff could certainly investigate the matter, but any actual prosecution would have to be undertaken in the state where the crime was committed."],"tt0041737":["Continuity: Frank Huggins appears with a group of men refilling the reservoir with a hosepipe, while simultaneously refilling his goldfish tank back at the shop."],"tt0183704":["Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: Watch for the drunken doctor's real arm on display as it supposedly gets chopped off."],"tt0038877":["Anachronisms: Ann Savage [/name/nm0767243/]'s stylishly blonded and bobbed hairstyle is strictly 1946, and relentlessly out of place in the 1864-1865 time frame in which the story is supposedly taking place."],"tt0032047":[],"tt0012563":[],"tt0118247":["Continuity: When the Nautilus is first sighted from the frigate Abraham Lincoln, it is declared to be \"...30 degrees off the port bow.\" However, in the long shot that shows the approaching light, it is off the starboard bow.","Revealing mistakes: After visiting Atlantis, the Nautilus surfaces.

According to Associated Press style, it should have read 10 p.m.","Continuity: When the horse rips loose on the ferry, it rips the rope from the wall without breaking the rope. In several subsequent shots, the rope is torn apart.","Continuity: When Noah is at the supermarket buying cigarettes, he pulls out of his pocket a bunch of junk such as coins, trash, and an old pack of cigarettes and dumps it on the counter. In the next shot of the counter, all the junk is gone except for a coin, and the old pack of cigarettes.","Continuity: When Rachel lifts Samara's body out of the water, her hand is covered by Samara's hair.

When Rachel falls into the well, she falls into water, not on concrete.","Continuity: When Rachel falls into the well, the torch light reaches the end of the well, meanwhile earlier on Noah says that they don't know how deep it is, as the light won't reach the bottom, and when they throw a rock into the well, it takes far too long to reach the bottom for how far Rachel falls into the water.","Continuity: When the father of Samara dies by electrocution in the bath, at first it shows blood, and then when you return to him dying, there is no blood in the bath.","Continuity: Mr Morgan tells Rachel to leave his house, he opens the door and you can see that the day is very sunny, when he closes the door, it's full of fog and very cloudy.","Continuity: When Rachel is researching Anna Morgan and Moesko Island in the newspaper archives, she is unconsciously scribbling on a picture of Anna. Between shots, the scribble changes shape from fanning outward to completely vertical.","Continuity: The level of the water in the well is not continuous.

The original sequence shows a chair sitting on the floor and then a ladder leaning against the wall. Later in the film, the chair is shown spinning upside down, and the ladder falls away from the wall.

Chrysler didn't introduce the Aspen/Volare until 1975.","Continuity: After Katie asks Boon about the previous night's Toga party, and she tells him she's busy that night, Otter puts his left hand on Boon's left shoulder. In the next shot, his right arm's on Boon's right shoulder.","Continuity: In the classroom, during the lecture on Milton, Jennings writes \"Satan\" on the boards very sloppily.

In close-ups, it's grass.","Continuity: While Niedermeyer is belittling Flounder, Boon selects a club and hands the golf bag to Otter. Cuts back to the \"you all are worthless and weak...\" speech, Boon hands the golf bag to Otter again.","Anachronisms: During the check out scene at the Food King, there is an old style pushbutton cash register in front of the teen age girl cashier, but from a different angle looking toward Boon, you can clearly see an electronic computerized NCR style cash register which would not be found in a supermarket in 1962, which is the year the movie is set in.","Crew or equipment visible: As Bluto makes his way down the cafeteria line, the feet of a crew member following him are visible in the angled mirror above the food.","Anachronisms: Many of the parade watchers wearing late 70's hairstyles, clothing.","Continuity: When Pinto arrives at the Delta house and gets a beer, his grip on the mug constantly changes from using the handle or just holding the mug.","Continuity: When Boon and Otter are looking down on the ROTC group on the field, Boon takes the golf clubs off his shoulder, selects a club, cut to the field, cut back to Boon and Otter, the clubs are back on his shoulder.","Continuity: When Bluto is on the ladder at the sorority house he first appears at the window on the left.

The second red convertible in the parade is a Cadillac. The first red convertible in the parade might be a 1961 or 1962 Olds Cutlass, but looks more like a 1962 Buick Skylark.","Factual errors: During the probation hearing the words \"Pan Hellenic Disciplinary Council\" can be seen written on the chalkboard; Pan Hellenic Council is the organization that governs sororities, not fraternities, which are regulated by Inter Fraternity Council.","Anachronisms: Stratton's Vette have what appear to be blue California plates. California did not introduce blue plates till 1970. (Best view is when they enter the first party.)","Continuity: When Pinto is in bed with the girl, she passes out as she is taking her bra off. As she falls over, the toilet paper in her bra hangs over Pinto's hands. The next shot when you see Pinto, the paper is in a ball.","Continuity: When Flounder and Sissy are going in to the toga party, she takes his arm with her bare hand, but when they get to the door, she is wearing gloves","Errors in geography: During the parade scene, when a police car skids to a stop on a side street, in the background you can clearly see a sign on a building, \"Cottage Grove Sentinel\". That's the name of the newspaper in Cottage Grove, Oregon, where the scene was filmed.","Continuity: When Bluto chugs the bottle of whiskey, he spills some on his sweater. In the next shot, his sweater is dry.","Boom mic visible: When Niedermyer is yelling at Flounder, the boom mic is reflected in his helmet.","Anachronisms: In the homecoming parade there is a float showing President Kennedy and the word \"Camelot\". The use of this word dates from an interview Jackie Kennedy gave Theodore H. White days after Kennedy's assassination in which she revealed that the President listened to the music from the Broadway musical \"Camelot\" before he went to sleep. The movie occurs before his death and uses a word not associated with the president at that time.","Revealing mistakes: When the exam papers being copied by the secretary, the copies are shown being cranked out. The header says \"PSYCHOLOGY 101\", yet the questions are clearly for a history exam.","Anachronisms: In the parade sequence near the end of the movie, there is a mid-'70s model Chevrolet pickup truck in the background.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Otis begins to sing the song \"Shout\", they zoom in on the big drum in the drum set which is red with gold letters. During the song the drum set center is now white with green letters.","Miscellaneous: In the food fight scene, all of the ROTC soldiers and Greg Marmalard fall on Neidermeyer when they are chasing Bluto. You clearly see Marmalard get up off of him and continue the chase. But, the next scene, you see the soldiers and Marmalard just getting up off of Neidermeyer.","Factual errors: When Larry and Kent are accepted to Delta House, they are awoken from bed with carbon dioxide extinguishers. The type used are aluminum cylinders which were not manufactured in 1962 and the label suggests they are Amerex extinguishers, Amerex was founded in 1971.","Anachronisms: In the Food King scene where Flounder is catching groceries tossed by Otter, items on the shelf have UPC symbols, which were not used until 1973. Also, there is Low-Calorie Nestea on the shelf (not available in 1962), and the product prices are too high for 1962.","Continuity: In the ROTC scene, after Otter hit's Niedermeyer's horse with a golf ball, the horse rears on its hind legs. When Otter hits his next ball at Niedermeyer's helmet, the horse is shown in a long view perfectly still.","Continuity: When Niedermeyer closes the door on Flounder at the Omega house they show a close up of him with the stairway in the background. Two red dressed girls are coming down the stairs. A second later the stairway is empty and then the girls start down the stairs again.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): As the ROTC cadets are marching down the street in the parade at the end of the movie, the left front cadet fails to spin his rifle with the others, and simply keeps marching.","Factual errors: During the disciplinary hearing scene, there are two flags pictured. One is an American flag, and the other is a Tennessee state flag, even though the film was supposed to have taken place in Pennsylvania. (This was due to the producers not being able to find a Pennsylvania flag that was large enough, so they settled on what they felt to be a fairly generic-looking state flag.)","Continuity: In the cafeteria scene when Bluto is filling his tray, the position of the food on the tray changes from shot to shot as he moves down the food line (esp. bananas).","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The American flags in Delta/Animal House are all 48-star, World War II-era flags. By 1962, when the film is set, America had 50 states. Therefore, the flags should all have 50 stars (although this could be deliberate to show that the members of Delta House are too lazy to get updated flags.)","Continuity: Niedermeyer forces Flounder to do push-ups in horse manure. But in the scenes that follow, including the \"killing Niedermeyer's horse\" scene, there is no trace of manure on his shirt.","Errors in geography: The movie is supposed to take place in New England, however during the night time scene in the football stadium with Pinto and Clorette, PAC 10 school banners can be seen hanging on the wall in the background (since the movie was actually filmed at the University of Oregon).","Anachronisms: To compound the previously cited geographical error of showing Pac 10 banners in the football stadium (the University of Oregon's Autzen Stadium), there is also an anachronism in this banner display. The Pac 10 would have been known as the Pac 5 or the Pac 6 in 1962 when this story is supposed to take place (Washington State University joined in that year). However, an OSU banner can clearly be seen: the University of Oregon and Oregon State University did not join the Pac 6 (which then became the Pac 8) until 1964.","Anachronisms: Right before Flounder spills the marbles in the street, he is seen holding them in a Kenner Spectograph box. This toy was not sold in the US until 1966.","Anachronisms: The Ludwig logos displayed on the marching band bass drum in the parade was not introduced until the 1970s. The logos used in the 1960s were much smaller, and used a script lettering (as used on Ringo Starr's trap set in the early Beatles films and recorded appearances).","Audio/visual unsynchronized: While Neidermeyer's horse is rearing its hind legs after Otter hit the horse with a golf ball, we hear Neidermeyer shout to the cadets \"Get back in ranks! Attention!\", but he is not speaking.","Factual errors: The ROTC cadets should have stood at proper attention for Niedermeyer's line inspection, called to it by Diller, by the squad leaders squad by squad, or even by Niedermeyer himself.","Factual errors: At the ROTC inspection, Neidermeyer salutes Chip Diller and Diller returns the salute. Since Chip Diller is the lower ranking officer, he should have saluted Neidermeyer, and Neidermeyer should have returned the salute.","Crew or equipment visible: Blutarsky (Belushi), dressed in pirates garb, climbs up the side of the building before he grabs the banner and rides it across the street. He is chased to the building by ROTC cadets. You can see a civilian give Belushi a two handed lift up in order to help him up the building. The ROTC cadets act as a screen to minimize our being able to see the boost.","Revealing mistakes: When pirate Bluto swings from the roof using a banner, his stunt harness cable is visible.","Crew or equipment visible: At the very beginning of the scene where Boon's golf ball smashes through Dean Wormer's window, a hand is visible flinging the ball at the window.","Miscellaneous: In addition to the previously mentioned error involving the Mayor's Oldsmobiles, although Mayor DePasto owns an Oldsmobile dealership, the car seen in his driveway when Larry brings his daughter home in the shopping cart after the toga party is a Buick. The mayor also promised free Oldsmobiles for the parade but the decorated car that Bluto tosses Mandy into is also a Buick.","Crew or equipment visible: In the lunch line, while Bluto is picking items from the shelves, the cameraman's feet can clearly be seen in the mirror above the shelves. As Bluto moves, so do the feet, facing Bluto.","Anachronisms: A major song that is featured in the movie is 'Louie, Louie'. The movie is supposed to take place in the Fall 1962 - Spring 1963 timeframe, however, 'Louie, Louie' (by the Kingsmen) was not released until late 1963 (November-December timeframe).","Revealing mistakes: During the toga party, as Boone is sitting alone and singing along with the band, in the background we see what is obviously a Budweiser logo on a lighted sign on the wall. But for the sake of not identifying the product, a large piece of what looks to be black electrical tape is placed over the name itself, leaving the actual logo intact.","Anachronisms: When Bluto hides behind the sorority house between some dumpsters, you can see a pressure sensitive ID label on one dumpster, a practice not used until the late 1970s.","Anachronisms: At the start of the road trip Otter refers to being \"In like Flint\". The phrase \"in like Flynn\" (a reference to the actor Errol Flynn) had been around for about 20 years prior to the movie's time period, and would likely have been known to Otter. But the line as spoken sounds like \"In like Flint\". \"In Like Flint\" was a movie, starring James Coburn, that was released in 1967, 5 years after the movie's events, and its title was a reference to the older phrase. Many people nowadays are familiar with the latter phrase and not the original, so this was probably a dialogue mistake.","Continuity: When Katy is about to hand the beer to Pinto, she is holding it in her left hand at the tap. She then switches it to her right hand as Pinto approaches and asks him if he wants a beer as she looks at his name tag she switches the beer back to her left hand.

The 6 bottles of Mazola oil are the only bottles on that aisle.","Continuity: In a scene in front of Delta House, the frat boys are planning to take Kent Dorfman's brothers car (the black Lincoln) to the Food King. While discussing it, in the first shot, there are two guys on the roof of Delta House (by the windows to the right of the porch). In the next shot, the roof is visible in the background but the guys are gone. In the third shot, as the Delta's get into the car, they're back again.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the scene on the football field where Larry is with his \"girl friend\" she says she's only 13.

These were written on the backs of the boards so they could be removed and replaced in between shots, preserving continuity. Some numbers are visible because some of the boards were nailed on backwards.","Continuity: Ben finds a pair of shoes and puts them on Barbara's feet, but in the very next shot where she's sitting on the couch, she is not wearing shoes nor are they any in the shot with her.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Ben kills the first two zombies by the truck, there is an audio mismatch between his blows and the impact sounds.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Ben is tell Barbara the story of about the zombies chasing the gas truck, his mouth does not match most of the words he is saying.","Crew or equipment visible: When Ben is about to strike the first zombie you can plainly see someones hand takes the tire iron out of his hand.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: In the end of the movie, when the 'patrol' shoots one of the zombies, you hear gunshots and you don't see them shoot until after the sound.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Harry and Tom first enter from the cellar, Tom yells \"Don't shoot!

You can see that to avoid actor injury, Ben is hammering the zombie at least 5 inches away from the zombie's head.","Crew or equipment visible: After Ben has struck one of the zombies outside the house to the ground, a cube of material, probably wood, is thrown next to the zombie's head, which Ben hits with the tire iron.","Continuity: When he first appears, the cemetery zombie's coat is open and unbuttoned. During the fight with Johnny and in subsequent scenes, two of the buttons are fastened.

He also says that it was \"screaming by\" and that zombies were chasing it on foot and keeping up - but all the zombies we've seen can be out run by even Barbara. He also says that the truck was on fire during this chase and there were zombies hanging onto the truck yet we've seen that the only thing that scares zombies is fire.","Errors in geography: In the opening scene, Johnny tells Barbra that they have a \"three-hour drive\" ahead of them to return home to Pittsburgh. However, later in the film when the TV broadcast is listing local rescue stations, all of the town names given are located in the greater Pittsburgh area.","Continuity: The live television remotes all seem to be taking place in daylight, although it's supposed to be the middle of the night when they're being aired.","Crew or equipment visible: At the beginning when Barbara and Ben are approaching the correct grave site a figure in black jumps behind a large headstone behind them.","Factual errors: Tom tells Ben that he and Judy were on their way to the lake to go swimming.

Rather this discussion should describe the two ways to come about: a \"jibe\" which is a downwind turn and a \"tack\" which is an upwind turn.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The BB gun used in the film is a Red Ryder as produced by Daisy. There is a reference to \"pumping\" 2 times, however, this is a simple weapon and can only be \"pumped\" one time.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): On Tripp's car there is no front plate. In Maryland where the film is set, there are license plates on the front of every car.","Revealing mistakes: The same car is used by both Demo and Kit, when it is supposed that they each own their own car.","Factual errors: When Tripp is showing Paula how to shoot the paintball marker, he is clearly rolling the trigger and the marker is not shooting so apparently it isn't on. But when Paula gets the marker in the next shot she shoots Ace in the foot. The marker is electric and you have to cut it on to shoot it. You couldn't see either one of them cutting the marker on so Paula shooting the marker would have actually been impossible without cutting it on.","Factual errors: The coffee shop patrons watch the real-time showdown between Tripp and Paula on the jumbo screen via Ace's laptop as a series of shots, which is impossible.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Avian CPR is performed with the bird in front of the human's face, tilted slightly away, with one hand supporting its head and the other its body. Ace performs the CPR with the bird on the table as if it were human.","Factual errors: Towards the end of the movie we find out that Justin Bartha [/name/nm0058581/]'s character, Ace, bought his house from his parents to avoid having to pay the inheritance tax when they pass away. The Federal inheritance tax in 2006 was on inheritances starting at $2 million.

The box itself moves around and alternates between partially open and completely closed.","Anachronisms: During one of the Christmas telephone conversations between Frank and Carl, Frank's phone has a modular telephone jack connection. Modular telephone jacks did not exist at the time.","Factual errors: Stopping a press like the one shown in the movie would not result in a flurry of cut checks flying through the air. Additionally, the cutter would be a machine that could fit the entire width of the paper, and make the precision cuts required for things like checks.","Anachronisms: When Frank is watching a court scene to prepare for his stint as a lawyer, the television clearly has a remote control infrared panel and control buttons on the front. Those didn't exist in the 1960s.","Anachronisms: As Frank first walks down the street in his Pan Am uniform, a Fedex delivery truck is partially visible in the background. Federal Express wasn't founded until 1971 and the Fedex logo on the truck was designed in 1994 when the company officially adopted the Fedex brand name.","Continuity: Frank kisses a girl and smudges her lipstick. In subsequent shots, the lipstick is smudge-free.","Anachronisms: We see TWA aircraft several times, all with the famous two stripe logo. That logo was not introduced until 1975, several years after when the movie was set.","Revealing mistakes: When Carl flips through Frank Jr.'s high school yearbook looking for his photo, the close-up shot reveals the same names duplicated on multiple pages of the book.","Anachronisms: When Frank and his father pull up to the Chase Bank, a Duane Reade drugstore in the background has a current logo.","Continuity: When Abagnale has dinner with his fiancé, he finishes the prayer and we see her shaking her napkin at him to let him know to put it in his lap. In the next shot, she is picking up her napkin.","Anachronisms: At Miami International Airport, the National Airlines logo should have been the \"SunKing\" logo, introduced in the mid-1960s.","Continuity: When Carl is visiting Frank in prison, the comic books jump around between shots.","Anachronisms: The slide projector used by Hanratty in his briefing on Abignale has a carousel, which was not released until Christmas of 1968.","Anachronisms: When Frank is arrested in France in the late 1960s, the police car he gets into has an antenna/defroster embedded in the rear window, which didn't exist then.","Anachronisms: The map of Europe Hanratty uses to figure out Abagnale's location is from at least the mid-1990s: Germany is unified, and the former Yugoslavia is divided into several different countries.","Revealing mistakes: When Hanratty makes a phone call outside Frank Sr.'s apartment, the entire phone booth shakes, as if it is not bolted to the ground.","Anachronisms: When Frank interviews potential stewardesses, one of them sings a line from the song \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\". This scene takes place in 1966 or 1967, long before the song was made popular by Peter, Paul, and Mary in 1969. The song was written in 1967 by John Denver (who made the song famous in 1973), which might have been before the scene in question, but it is highly unlikely that a student would have known the song before 1969.","Continuity: The non-speaking role of \"stewardess\" Miggy is played by Amy Acker [/name/nm0009918/] for the scene in the hall and when the stewardesses get out of the car with Frank outside the airport. However, for the scenes inside the airport, another (non-credited) actress has replaced her.","Continuity: When Frank Sr. hugs his son during the pancake scene, his jacket moves about between shots.","Continuity: When Frank gets to Miami International Airport to wait for his fiancé, a car driven by a man wearing a hat stops right behind him. When Frank looks around searching for potential police, the door of the car behind is opening. In the next shot, the car behind him is gone.","Errors in geography: When the French police come to catch Frank, the plate number of their car is 44 (number of the state). Montrichard's plate number is 41; Loire Atlantique is 44.","Anachronisms: The front-loading washers in the laundromat are Wascomat W74 Front Loading washing machines. The square door handle and rotary temperature control knob were introduced in the 1980s.","Continuity: It is sunny at poolside at the Tropicana in L.A., with young ladies sunbathing. When Frank is almost caught in his motel room, he points to the \"perp\" being escorted to the car by \"another Secret Service man.\" The streets are clearly wet, and the car is covered with raindrops.","Factual errors: In the 1960s, French police cars had yellow flashing lights, not blue.","Anachronisms: When we first see Brenda at the hospital, she is wearing 1970s-style braces on her teeth.","Continuity: En route to Handratty's first confrontation with Frank Jr., Amdursky and Fox are wearing sunglasses in one shot as the car turns into the hotel parking lot (after the \"knock-knock joke\"), but not in others.","Factual errors: When Hanratty is briefing fellow FBI agents about check routing, the first US map has many geographical errors: Kansas City is where Omaha should be, St. Louis is in middle of Missouri, and Boston is in Maine. When the same map is shown again, the cities are correctly located, and the map shading scheme has changed.","Anachronisms: Brenda is last seen waiting at the Miami airport directly behind a sidewalk curbcut for wheelchairs which was not introduced until at least the mid-1970s, particularly after federal legislation for the handicapped was enacted.","Continuity: When the little girl on the street asks Frank if he's a \"real live pilot\", she's standing in front of a yellow car. After he speaks to her, he begins to walk away, and the yellow car is gone.","Factual errors: When the FBI agents tell Frank's mom how much money he has stolen, she reaches for a pack of Kent cigarettes. The cigarette she lights has a \"cork\" filter. Kents had a white filter.","Anachronisms: Early in the movie, when Frank Sr. attempts to pull off a bank heist with the help of Frank Jr., a 1980s city bus is in the background.","Continuity: Frank points out the Manhattan skyline from the plane. They are at a much higher altitude in a subsequent shot, and only clouds are visible.","Anachronisms: In several scenes, Agent Hanratty uses the \"Weaver Stance\" when holding a handgun. This is particularly evident when he first meets Secret Service Agent \"Barry Allen\" in the hotel room. Most of the movie takes place during the 1950s and 1960s. The \"Weaver Stance\" was first developed during the 1950s, and not widely taught widely until the late 1970s.","Anachronisms: The bottle of Tab diet cola in pool scene is from late 1970s.","Anachronisms: Use of OCR-A character-reader font on letters, driver's license. It was first introduced in 1970.","Continuity: When Frank tries to escape after printing the checks, he is holding the checks in his arms in a disorganized pile. In the next shot, before he throws them to the floor, they are sorted more neatly.","Anachronisms: In the beginning of the movie, Hanratty visits Frank in a French prison and notifies him the terms of his extradition \"according to the European Convention on Human Rights\". France ratified the European convention on 3 May 1974, and would't have applied in 1969, when the scene takes place.","Factual errors: In the closing credits, \"Saxophone solos\" is misspelled as \"Saxaphone solos.\"","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Carl confronts Frank in France, just after he yells \"They're going to kill you!\" his mouth moves after that, but you don't hear anything.","Anachronisms: When Carl is sitting in his office watching the checks, the stamp on the back of one check is from 1997. The scene takes place in 1967.","Continuity: When Frank Sr. and Frank Jr. are entering at Chase Manhattan Bank, a little white truck is shown three times, twice going in the same direction in a couple of seconds.","Continuity: When Frank is walking down the street with his new co-pilot uniform, the sidewalk is dry. In the next shot, the camera is above his head and the sidewalk is wet.","Factual errors: Many of the cars in this movie have new style aero dynamic black wiper blades. Cars of that time period had standard silver/chrome colored wiper blades.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Hanratty shows his ID to a frightened maid at the top of a hotel staircase, the badge with the FBI logo is facing the camera and not her, so in actual fact all she would see is the black leather outer of the wallet.","Anachronisms: When the plane that takes Frank Jr. and Carl back to the States lands, we are shown a sequence where the wheels touch the runway. The exterior shots are of a 767, which did not fly until 1981. The interior shots are of a 707.","Factual errors: When Frank Abagnale Jr. flies \"deadhead\" in the cockpit of a TWA plane, the cockpit windshield has a central pane, without a metal divider in the center. At the time, the only jet airliner with that type of windshield was the Douglas DC-8. TWA flew the Boeing 707, not the DC-8.","Factual errors: When Frank goes to the flight deck to ride on the jump seat, the jump seat that is pulled out has no restraints on it.","Anachronisms: When Frank's father opens a checking account for him in early 1964, the checks are imprinted with ZIP codes. ZIP codes were introduced in 1963, but they weren't widely used until the mid-Sixties.","Anachronisms: During a scene set in 1965, characters listen to the song The Look of Love, first released in 1967.","Anachronisms: A lava lamp appears in scene set in 1965, three years before lamp was marketed.","Continuity: When Hanratty and his two assistants go to Frank's mother's house, one of the assistants grabs a piece of dessert and tries to reach a fork that is on a plate in front of Hanratty. Hanratty has a paper in his right hand in one shot while he's looking at the lady. In the next shot is right hand is empty and free to instantly grab a fork for his colleague and hand it to him in that comedic stabbing motion.","Continuity: Frank calls Carl every Christmas, starting in 1966. In '66 Carl is working alone. The next time in '67 Carl is working with his team. Then the next year, when Carl and Frank are in France, the subtitles say 1967. Shouldn't it be 1968?","Continuity: When Frank Jr impersonates the substitute French teacher in order to take revenge on the bullies who bumped into him in the hallway, he shouts for order in the classroom then asks which chapter the previous teacher left off on. Frank Jr then opens his book up to the correct page, and after embarrassing one of the bullies by making him read out loud, he begins to walk to the front of the room. When he is in the aisle in the classroom, he holds the book open as he walks. After the shot changes angle and distance, he completes his walk to the front of the room, but the book is now closed.","Anachronisms: In the scene at the Miami airport, which was set in the late 1960s, Checker cabs with impact absorbing bumpers are seen. Impact absorbing bumpers did not appear on cars until late 1972 (for the 1973 model year.) The cabs are at least 1974 models, when impact absorbing bumpers for both the front and back of the car were required.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): During the course of the movie Hanratty's New York accent appeared and disappears. During the very beginning it is extremely thick; but when he's on the plane with Frank Jr. it is nonexistent.","Revealing mistakes: In the FBI office, all of the desk chairs are Pollack chairs. Designed by Charles Pollack for Knoll in 1965, it's possible that these chairs might have gotten to the FBI offices by that date. What's not possible is that the FBI would have spent the money on these chairs; they are very expensive and would never have been standard government issue.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): As Frank and Carl are flying back to the US, Frank says that he sees runway 44 at LaGuardia. Runway numbers are based on compass headings ranging from 01-36. LaGuardia does have a runway 04, which would head roughly northeast.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the scene where Frank Abagnale walks through Miami International Airport surrounded by newly recruited Pan Am stewardesses, the stewardesses are wearing their hats wrong. The Pan Am emblem is supposed to show from the front, whereas these recruits wore their hats with the emblem toward the back.","Anachronisms: When Frank first walks into the classroom where he impersonates the substitute teacher, one of the students is heard to use the word \"frickin'\", which is a recent word, and not in use in the 1960s.","Continuity: Frank Abagnale Jr.is given a co-pilot's jacket (two stripes) at the outfitters. However, immediately afterwards when he is seen walking away he's wearing a senior co-pilot's jacket (three stripes) and continues to wear that rank throughout the pilot scenes.","Crew or equipment visible: At the end of the film, when the camera pans out through the FBI office, the last row of file cabinets can be seen being pushed together into place after the camera has passed through. A crew member can be seen on the left side of the screen trying to duck out of the shot after you see him pushing the left file cabinet.","Anachronisms: Early in the film in the sequence showing the family's move from a house to an apartment, there is a shot of the apartment building taken from the street outside. As the camera pans upward to show the whole building, a video security camera can be seen in the top right corner of the shot, apparently mounted on a telephone pole opposite the building. Such security cameras did not exist at that time.","Factual errors: While Frank and Carl are flying back to the US Frank looks out the window and tells Frank that they are over LaGuardia Airport and runway Number 44. All runway ends are painted/labeled based on the compass direction or bearing it is facing or heading. A Due North is runway \"36\", meaning 360 degrees and the opposite end marked \"18\", for 180 degrees. Runway numbers include 1 to 36. No runway 44 exists.","Anachronisms: Police lights on top of the French police cars, in addition to being the incorrect color for the time period (blue, should be yellow) are Peterson Mfg model 771, which is a modern, low cost, light. Peterson did not make this model until the late 1980s.","Revealing mistakes: When Hanratty is in the laundromat he pulls a red sweater out of the dryer that changes his clothes pink. But, the lady who grabs the sweater from him is also doing a white load. It seems very unlikely that she would have had that sweater in her clothes, and if she did her clothes would have been pink as well from the wash.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Hanratty is trying to catch Abagnale at Miami Airport, the driver of the vehicle that was sent to detour them pulls out a sign that reads \"Handratty\", with a \"D\"","Continuity: When Frank Jr. is talking to Cheryl Ann (Garner) in the hallway, he is seen at one point leaning against the wall. In a subsequent shot, he is seen standing upright and then purposefully leans against the wall.","Revealing mistakes: When Frank sees the pilots coming out of the car with the stewardesses, before he decides to become a pilot himself, the pilots and stewardesses are moving in slow-motion. When you look at the people around them, you see they are moving at normal speed.","Anachronisms: During the parts of movie that are set in the early-to-mid 1960s, Pan American Airlines is constantly referred to as \"Pan Am.\" A shot of its office building even shows the \"Pan Am\" logo on it. However, Pan American Airlines was abbreviated as \"PAA\" during this time, and did not adopt the \"Pan Am\" logo until 1972. (In the I Love Lucy episode \"Return Home from Europe\" from 1956, Ethel's handbag on the plane ride has the PAA logo.)","Anachronisms: In the beginning of the movie there are four Citroens parked in front of the prison. One of them is a Citroen 2cv Charleston (the dark-red/black behind the police cars). This car was produced in the 80's, so it would have been impossible to have one parked outside in '69.","Factual errors: Toward the end of the movie when Frank is walking in the corridor tube at the airport there are a couple American Airlines flights announced in the background. This was in the TWA terminal. It's possible that the filmmakers did this intentionally since American bought TWA at the time the movie was filmed, but in the late 60's there would not be an American flight in the TWA terminal as they were fierce rivals.","Anachronisms: A title card for the arrest scene is dated \"Christmas Eve 1967.\" Several of the French police cars are Citroen DS models with four front headlights. Citroen did not update the DS to use double headlights until the 1968 model year. Although Citroen, like US automakers, does typically announce new models in the fall previous to that model year's release, it is extremely unlikely the entire fleet of police cars in a small French village would use only next year's model."],"tt0131072":[],"tt0034637":[],"tt0010323":["Continuity: When Alan and Francis part company, they are initially right next to each other, but then at arm's reach.","Continuity: There is an inconsistent positioning during the struggle on the bed between Cesare and Jane.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Although Cesare is described as being a somnambulist - that is, a sleepwalker - he actually appears to be a narcoleptic, someone who has seizures in which they appear to have fallen asleep.","Revealing mistakes: In most prints, many of the shots have a bar across the top of the frame resembling the bottom edge of the same frame.

However, as the scene continues, the group ends up atop the Queen Anne neighborhood, which is a northern part of Seattle."],"tt0031958":[],"tt0020142":["Continuity: (At 21:00) Philip puts his right hand in his pocket, but it is not in the pocket in the subsequent shot.","Continuity: The facing of Pete's head changes between shots when he is resting it on Phil's shoulder while awaiting news about the baby.","Continuity: Discontinuity with Kate's father's hands when he holds the back of the rocking chair before telling Pete the news about the baby. In one shot he has two hands on the chair, then in the next shot of Pete's face there aren't any hands seen on the chair.","Continuity: After Kate tells Philip she is going to retrieve their baby, Philip is shown running to the door twice in subsequent shots."],"tt0035396":["Continuity: When Gabby pulls the tablecloth off the table, there is a large bowl with a serving spoon in it that stops near the edge.

That night everyone comments on how beautiful the moon is and we later learn it is 8:30pm. The moon did not rise until midnight on that date. In fact the sun did not set until 8:30pm. Additionally, crickets can be heard loudly chirping throughout these scenes. This would be very unusual for early June, but common in late August."],"tt0091059":["Crew or equipment visible: When Dave, Max and the Puckmarin are moving to the music, listening to the Beach Boys, the strings used to control the motions of the Puckmarin are visible.","Revealing mistakes: When the ship is first emerging from the holding facility, you can see the black mechanical arm attached to the back of the ship extending it out into the daylight.","Continuity: The length and style of David's hair changes noticeably between shots on several occasions during the second half of the film.","Factual errors: Toward the end of the movie, David's family is watching \"The Price is Right\" while waiting for David to return. While talking to his brother he says, \"It will be dark soon\". Bob Barker is shown as the host, but in 1985 and 1986, Tom Kennedy was the host of the evening addition of \"The Price is Right.","Anachronisms: In the scene where David is watching Jennifer through a telescope, the song Lovefire is playing from the movie Roller Boogie. Flight Of The Navigator starts out in July of 1978, but Roller Boogie didn't come out until December of 1979.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): MAX says Humans only use 10% of their brain. This is an urban myth.","Crew or equipment visible: When David first sees the Puckmarin, the strings used to make it move are clearly visible (especially on the right).","Crew or equipment visible: In the scene where David is outside the ship in the Florida cow field, the shadow of the framework holding up the ship is visible when the ship is viewed from the air. You can also see several dents in the ship's finish.","Continuity: While first looking at the road map on board the ship, David is shown chewing a piece of the Nestle Crunch bar that he bought at the gas station. The next shot shows the bar close-up, but in that shot a bite hasn't been taken out of it yet. When the camera cuts back to a wide shot, the bar once again has large bite missing from it.","Errors in geography: At the beginning of the movie, David falls into a deep ravine. However, south Florida is totally flat - if you fall more than 2 feet below ground, you are in a canal in water. Also, the vegetation is not south Florida either, so this scene was not shot in south Florida.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When David is interviewed at the hospital, a lady asks him what happened to him at the woods after getting scared by his brother. David replies: \"I chased him for a while, then I reached this cliff... I know I fell\". Actually, he made only a couple of steps after his brother (hardly a \"while\"), then turned and walked toward the ravine, with no \"cliffs\" in sight. He does seem to be confused and distracted during the interview, which is hardly surprising under the circumstances.","Anachronisms: In the opening scene with the Frisbee that takes place in 1978, Miami's Southeast Financial Center Building is clearly visible which was not completed until 1984","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: It is often claimed that when the starship is falling out of control, it is over the Gulf of Mexico or the Florida coast, which is contradicted by the fact that it's falling into a region filled with snowy mountains. However, the radar map clearly shows that the ship is actually over the southern coast of Alaska (San Francisco and Seattle can be seen in the lower part of the radar map), where such mountains are abundant. The confusion is due to the fact that the ship has flown from Florida to Alaska in what appears to be just a couple of minutes. Later scenes confirm that it really can move that fast.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When David and Max are flying back to Ft. Lauderdale, supposedly following I-95, they pass a road sign that indicates Miami is 25 miles away, and Ft. Lauderdale is 58 miles away. Since Miami is south of Ft. Lauderdale, this means that they are flying north and located to the south of Miami, while I-95 exists only to the north of Miami. Subsequent scene confirms that they are indeed flying north, since they pass Miami Beach on the left. However, nothing indicates that they were ever flying along I-95, so it's more likely that they simply misread the map and reached that road sign by luck. Previous dialogs do indicate that both David and Max are very bad at navigation.","Continuity: MAX, the space pod, in bigger on the inside than on the outside (this is evident by looking at the ship's hatch: the bottom of the hatch is near the bottom of the ship, but the inside has room for retractable engines, controls, and a pilot's chair). However, this may be deliberate as classic science fiction had ships that were larger inside than outside.","Continuity: Dr. Faraday's assistant remarks that the spaceship has no doors, windows, or seams. However, when the ship lands at David's family's home at the end of the movie, you can clearly see the outline of its hatch.","Factual errors: During the \"Third-Class Maneuver,\" Max takes David straight up to 20 miles in altitude. David is subsequently shown floating in the interior as if weightless. However, 20 miles up is only 105,800 feet, still well within the Earth's gravitational field (experimental and military aircraft routinely fly at that altitude).","Factual errors: SPOILER: David \"says\" that he had traveled for 4.4 hours, during which 8 years had passed on Earth. Dr. Faraday explains this by saying that David has \"traveled beyond the speed of light\" and also that \"time slows down when you approach the speed of light\", all, supposedly, according to the \"Light Speed Theory\". In reality, there is no scientific theory by that name, although it's sometimes used (wrongly) as a reference to the Special Theory of Relativity. However, no valid theory allows traveling \"beyond the speed of light\". It might be argued that the physical reality (and the scientific knowledge) in the movie is different from ours, but nothing else in the movie supports such a claim. The second of Dr. Faraday's statements is basically correct within the Special Relativity, but according to it David should have returned 1120 years later, not 8, given the distance of 560 light years to Phaelon. To generate an eight year time lag, Phaelon has to be about four light years away, not 560."],"tt0029626":[],"tt0037811":[],"tt0029627":[],"tt0032065":[],"tt0004099":[],"tt0203050":[],"tt0067245":[],"tt0043618":[],"tt0038764":[],"tt0044008":["Continuity: When Scrooge and Marley offer to buy up the company from Mr. Jorkin, the medium shots show Marley with his hands in his vest pockets, but every close-up has his hands clasped on his stomach.","Continuity: Early in the movie, Scrooge is complaining about having to give Bob Cratchit Christmas day off with pay. Scrooge puts his scarf on and then Cratchit helps him put his coat on, over the scarf. In the next shot, Scrooge is seen walking outside with the scarf wrapped over his mouth, outside of his of coat.","Crew or equipment visible: Towards the end of the film, after Scrooge's reformation while he's looking at himself in a mirror, there are staff/cameramen visible in the mirror as well.","Anachronisms: When Scrooge gives his housekeeper a Christmas Bonus and increases her wages to ten shillings a week, she runs down the stairs exclaiming in joy \"Bob's your uncle!\" No one would have ever used that term during the time the story takes place, in 1843. The phrase is used to describe British Prime Minister Robert Cecil's appointment of his unqualified nephew, Arthur Balfour, as the Chief Secretary of Ireland, in 1887. Charles Dickens [/name/nm0002042/]' characters would have to wait another 44 years to use the phrase which describes good fortune out of nothing, or the exclamation of happiness from simplicity.","Anachronisms: In an early scene, Scrooge refuses Samuel Wilkins' request for a Christmas postponement, by saying \"You'd still owe me £20 you're not in a position to repay if it was the middle of a heatwave on an August Bank Holiday\". This refers to a law enacted in 1871, after Charles Dickens [/name/nm0002042/]' death.","Crew or equipment visible: When Scrooge and the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come are looking through Bob Cratchit's window, C. Konarski [/name/nm0464828/]'s face is clearly visible for a second.","Plot holes: Mrs. Dilber did not live with Scrooge. Yet, on Christmas morning, she woke him from slumber by knocking on his bedroom door. However, since Scrooge locked the door to his house the night before (including two inner sliding deadbolts, one on the top of the door, one on the bottom), Mrs. Dilber could not have gotten into the house the next morning.","Revealing mistakes: When Scrooge and Marley observe the poor woman through the window and the spirits lamenting that they cannot help her, one of the spirits is clearly Mervyn Johns [/name/nm0424345/] who also plays Bob Cratchit.","Revealing mistakes: From the day he buys Mr. Fezziwig's shop (which employs a very young Scrooge and Marley) until his retirement with embezzled funds (when those two are extremely old), Mr. Jorkin doesn't seem to age a day."],"tt0023580":[],"tt0125439":["Continuity: Honey starts the film with shoulder length hair.

When she announces she's getting engaged to Spike at the closing of Tony's restaurant, it is short again. The film only spans about a year.","Continuity: When Anna first comes into William's house, William tells her, \"The bathroom's on the top floor, and the telephone's just... just up there\" (pointing to the landing, one flight up). However, we see later that the bathroom's only two flights up; William's bedroom is on the top floor, three flights up.

The upper row (a single ribbon) is crooked and ready to fall off. Apparently it did fall off, because in his next scene the upper ribbon is now missing.","Revealing mistakes: The mausoleum where the ghoul man was buried was made of wood and had its door hung crooked.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Criswell [/name/nm0188186/]'s opening narration (where he can be seen reading off of cue cards) begins: \"Greetings, my friends. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember, my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future.\" A moment later, though, he is placing the same events in the past, telling how \"what happened on that fateful day\" must no longer be kept secret. In the next paragraph he says it's sundown when it's obviously broad daylight.","Revealing mistakes: Stock footage shows a completely different cemetery.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): A man at the old man's funeral says that it's \"getting dark.\" It's already pitch black.","Revealing mistakes: A strong wind from the flying saucer's exhaust is enough to blow Jeff and Paula to the ground, but not to move their hair. This is true every time people get knocked to the ground.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Jeff complains to his wife, Paula (Mona McKinnon [/name/nm0571958/]), about having to hush up his UFO sighting, he calls her \"Mona\".","Revealing mistakes: The shot of the Ghoul Man walking down a path towards the cemetery is repeated many times during the course of the movie.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Tor Johnson [/name/nm0426363/]'s character, a police detective, is called \"Inspector Dan Clay\". Although San Francisco and a few other cities use the title \"Inspector\" for their detectives, virtually every police department in California - and in Los Angeles, Burbank and San Fernando, where this was filmed - uses the title \"Detective\".","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The gravediggers apparently don't fill the grave we've seen before, they just throw the earth behind them, as if they started to dig a new hole. Still in the same position, their work is then declared to be done and they leave the place. There is no new or any other grave on the scene which is supposed to take place on the cemetery.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The aliens are frustrated that the Earth people refuse to acknowledge their existence, yet go to extreme lengths to remain secret, such as killing witnesses.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): After General Roberts and Colonel Edwards finish their briefing, they salute each other. Air Force personnel do not give salute indoors unless reporting to a superior.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Police officers are generally trained in how to properly handle firearms - yet in several scenes they are seen to grossly mishandle them, such as using the barrels of their pistols to adjust their hats, scratch the sides of their heads and gesture at others, all while their fingers are clearly on the triggers.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): It is said that Col. Edwards is in charge of a division of the government specifically for dealing with saucers, yet during their meeting, Gen. Roberts insinuates that Edwards could be in trouble for acknowledging that saucers exist, due to a government directive stating that saucers don't exist.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): General Roberts says that the alien radio messages are garbled by \"atmospheric conditions in outer space.\" The vacuum of space has no \"atmosphere.\"","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: It is said that the Pentagon is in Washington, D.C. It's really in Arlington, Virginia. However, Arlington is part of the D.C. Metro Area, being a small patch right up against the border, and a large portion of its residents are Federal personnel who commute to work in Washington each day and consider themselves to be Washingtonian in their souls. For these reasons, the Pentagon is universally referred to in real life as \"the Pentagon in Washington\" which is an easily memorable expression even if not legally true. The movie reflects this cultural quirk.","Errors in geography: The scenes of the military attacking the flying saucers with artillery guns are obviously taken from stock footage of the Korean War. You can even see the thatched huts of a Korean village in the background, even though the action is supposedly taking place in California.","Errors in geography: Stock footage of rocket launchers is used to show the attack on the flying saucers, which are up in the air. The rocket launchers are ground-to-ground weapons. Also, one of the rocket launcher vehicles shown is a Russian 'Katyusha' truck, filmed during the Russian counteroffensive during WWII.","Crew or equipment visible: Inside the cockpit, the rim of the spotlight is visible for the duration of this and subsequent shots in the cockpit.","Revealing mistakes: Just before Inspector Clay resurrects, and the dirt falls back into the open grave, you can see there is a blanket underneath the dirt, which is used to pull down the dirt.","Crew or equipment visible: In the cockpit when the plane moves from side to side, the movements of the set and of the spotlight are out of sync.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: The Old Man walks into the street and we clearly hear him get hit by a car, but his shadow is still on the ground.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: A special computer is needed for Alien-English translation, as shown in the Pentagon briefing. Prior to the final confrontation, Eros turns on a similar computer within the spaceship, thus the aliens and humans can talk to each other and argue about \"stupid stupid stupid\" for the climax. The scene where he turns it on rushes by so fast that most viewers miss it, but it's there.","Revealing mistakes: In some of the scenes where the aliens are discussing their plans while in the spacecraft they seem to be wearing wide belts decorated with the outline of Christmas trees. Real aliens are unlikely to wear this style of clothing.","Revealing mistakes: In the cockpit scenes, the pilot sitting on the left is reading his lines from a script on his lap.","Factual errors: The pilot sitting on the left in the cockpit scenes calls in to the air traffic control tower using a candlestick telephone. Pilots use hand held CB radios for communication purposes."],"tt0057569":["Revealing mistakes: When the castle floods, some of the stone floats.","Continuity: Karloff has stark white hair throughout, though his stunt double in the water at the climax has black hair.","Anachronisms: When Jack Nicholson is in the room searching he comes upon a set of dueling pistols. When he opens the chamber of one, you see a metallic cartridge which were not invented for another 40 years.","Anachronisms: Samuel Colt (1814-1862), the inventor of the revolver, took his first European patent for his invention in 1835, and as Lt. Duvalier searches the castle, he carries a revolver around. The movie is set 20 years after Ilse's death, making the year 1802, as her gravestone clearly states 1761-1782, therefore Lt. Duvalier is carrying around a weapon made by a man who won't be born until 12 years later. Another matter of curiosity regarding this is the fact that it is a snub-nosed revolver, though nobody exactly knows when it was conceived, most believe it was invented in the American west in the late 19th century, presumably by a person who thought it would be easier to fast-draw from a holster.","Revealing mistakes: Watch for the stones falling from the castle ceiling at the end, then floating away.","Anachronisms: At the end of the film we learn that Baron Von Leppe is in actuality the witch Katerina's son, Eric. However, Boris Karloff was 76 years old in 1963 and Dorothy Neumann was only 49 so this added plot twist becomes even more ludicrous."],"tt0031282":[],"tt0043759":[],"tt0120746":["Anachronisms: The movie was set around 1841, but a pressure gauge measures in metric units which were not adopted in Mexico until the 1860s.","Anachronisms: Elena has a nylon zipper on her dress in the last scene. Zippers were not used in the 1840's and nylon was not used for this purpose until after WWII.","Revealing mistakes: When Don Rafael Montero shows a gold bar to the other Dons, he holds it only with two fingers and shows no signs that it's heavy. A gold bar this size would be much too heavy for anyone to hold like that.","Anachronisms: Don Rafael Montero that says he came via Lisbon and San Francisco. In 1841, San Francisco was still Yerba Buena. The name change didn't occur until January, 1847.","Factual errors: The Mexican flag appearing in the headquarters when Zorro is fighting the soldiers has the red and green areas reversed.","Continuity: When Don Diego is fighting Alejandro in the Cantina, there are some hay stacks in the corner. When Alejandro attacks Zorro, one of the hay stacks falls down but in the next scene it's up again in the corner.","Revealing mistakes: When he dismounts to stop the burning wick, it is obvious Captain Love's saddle cover is made of fake leopard skin material.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: In the confessional, Elena says she broke the fourth commandment. For Roman Catholics, \"honor thy father and mother\" is the fourth commandment, not the fifth.","Revealing mistakes: When Zorro is surfing down the gulch on a shovel during his fight with Captain Love, a strap holding his foot to the shovel can be seen.","Continuity: During a training exercise, Alejandro knocks Diego's sword from his hand and catches it. As he throws it back, the blade points down; when Diego catches it, the blade is pointed up.","Revealing mistakes: As Zorro is swinging on a tree branch just before kicking Captain Love, the parallel bars used for the tree limbs are clearly visible.","Continuity: When Alejandro is fighting Captain Love at the gold mine, he stops the large wheel from spinning by sticking something in it. The next time we see it, the ladder is in there holding the wheel, but it is not broken anymore. When he jumps off the platform the wheel starts moving and then stops again.","Crew or equipment visible: When one of the Dons comes into the room where de la Vega is hiding at the party, stage lighting is briefly visible when the door is opened.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Don Diego is about to confront Don Rafael for the first time, he begins talking in the shadows but his voice isn't in sync with the picture.","Continuity: When Zorro is cheered by crowds near the beginning of the film, the shots of him were taken at sunset, but the shots of the crowd were taken closer to midday.","Revealing mistakes: When Alejandro calms the horse gone wild in the crowd, the rope tied to the horse can be seen dropped by someone off screen the moment Alejandro grabs for it.","Revealing mistakes: When Zorro undresses Elena with his sword, the clothes are clearly ripped off by a string attached to them, rather than falling off by themselves. (See also the item in the trivia section.)","Continuity: Alejandro, dressed as Zorro, fights the guards and grabs the \"chandelier\". The candles were lit, then when he swings on them, they are blown out. In the next shot, they are lit again.","Continuity: After Zorro undresses Elena with his sword, she covers her breasts with his hat. When he snatches his hat away from her, the hand in the close up is not wearing a glove, even though Zorro was wearing gloves throughout the entire sequence.","Continuity: When Don Rafael arrives in the lifeboat, the camera in the boat shows six rowers, all wearing navy blue army uniforms and hats. In the next shot, there are only four rowers, and the two on the left side are wearing white bandannas on their heads.","Continuity: When Zorro is knocking off guards from their horses in order to get to his horse in the front, during a moment when he's standing upon two horses you can hear him yell and the sound of grunts. Then when you see Zorro attack two guys by slamming them together, the same sound plays.","Revealing mistakes: When we first meet Alejandro's soon-to-be horse, you can see changes. The horse's mane changes consistency from straight to wavy as the horse is rearing in two different shots.","Continuity: When Don Raphael and Captain Love are seen in the hacienda's study discussing the plans to destroy \"all the evidence\" (the mine and its workers), we see plainly Captain Love's sword belt, with no bowie knife scabbard attached. When, shortly thereafter, Zorro fights Love and Raphael because of the missing map to the mine, Love's bowie knife scabbard has reappeared.","Continuity: In the barn, there is clearly a different horse used in the bucking section. Zorro's soon to be horse is large with a thick, wavy mane and tail. The horse that is actually bucking is smaller, with a thin straight tail.","Revealing mistakes: When we see Alejandro in the guards place were the black Andalusian was taken, he picks up a barrel of gunpowder to stop it from exploding and as he goes out the door leaving a trail of it. When he comes out of the door you can quite clearly see the trail of gunpowder already laid down in front of him before he gets there.","Continuity: When Alejandro tells the soldiers to touch their toes, one of them is in front of the other. But when Alejandro kicks them out the window they are side by side.","Continuity: When Alejandro is fighting Captain Love, his hat falls off when he is swinging on the tree branches. When he lands to pick up his sword, the hat is back on again.","Crew or equipment visible: When the two prison guards return with the bag to carry away the dead prisoner in, an iron door swings back before they pass through. The crew member who pulls it open it is briefly visible at the far right of the screen (widescreen only).","Revealing mistakes: When Zorro rides up the steps while cheered by crowds near the beginning of the film, his shadow is on the wall behind him even though the setting sun is *behind* the building.","Revealing mistakes: When Zorro first appears, saving the men from execution, he leaps down from a rooftop unto a balcony. Shot from overhead, it's quite obvious he lands on a stunt pad (the stone yields just like a cushion).","Audio/visual unsynchronized: After the big chase scene, as Zorro and his horse canter up the hill, the horse's steps don't match the hoof beats heard.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Tornado, the black horse of Zorro, isn't an Andalusian (as called by Diego) but a Friesian. (It has the typical feathers on its hoofs and is of stockier build.)","Continuity: SPOILER: When Zorro is fighting Captain Love in the mine, and Zorro pushes him down and Captain Love rolls down the way until he stops at some boards, when Zorro pushes him you can see he loses his sword, and the sword falls all the way with him. In the next shot, when he's already at the bottom, you can see he's holding the sword, like he never lost it while he was falling.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Alejandro (Zorro) kills Capt. Love, only a little part of the sword crosses the Captain. In the next scene, from above, the sword crosses him to the half, and the point of the sword clearly doesn't match with the rest.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: SPOILER: During Zorro's big duel at the end, he carves an 'M' on Captain Love's cheek. The letter 'M' is made of four lines, therefore four cuts would be required to carve one. If you listen carefully however, you can hear five cuts being made."],"tt0037296":[],"tt0224042":[],"tt0372763":[],"tt0093748":["Errors in geography: A bus from Jefferson City to St. Louis would not cross the Mississippi; it would enter St. Louis from the other direction.","Continuity: The length of Del's cigarette while he's singing in the car.","Continuity: Hubcaps can be seen falling off the car, only to return in later shots. Further, the same hubcap can be seen falling off twice.","Continuity: When Neal returns to the station to collect Del, his parting changes sides.","Continuity: When Neal is walking from the parking lot (where his rented car should be) to the main terminal, a brief clipping indicates that the sun is going down. However, when Neal is at the terminal, it appears to be mid-afternoon.","Continuity: The length of Dell's cigarette when in the restaurant. (When Neil is about to tell him that he wants to travel alone.)","Crew or equipment visible: When Neal calls home to tell his wife he is delayed, while they are sitting at the table, a woman's head and shoulders are visible holding the toddler on the chair (Pan and Scan version only)","Continuity: When Neal chases after his cab, his brief case and garment bag switch hands a few times.","Crew or equipment visible: When Neal Page is dropped off at the car rental parking lot, he looks for his parking space, V5. When he is looking, the camera is reflected in the back of one of the cars.","Errors in geography: When travelling by rented car from St. Louis to Chicago, they get pulled over by a Wisconsin State Trooper. Wisconsin is to the north and would not be in any way on the route to Chicago.","Continuity: While sitting and waiting for a ride to the train station, Neal is wearing black snow boots, when throughout the film he is always wearing dress shoes.","Continuity: Del and Neal's departing flight is clearly an American Airlines twin-engine jet taxiing on the runway. An exterior shot of their plane in flight shows a four-engine, earlier generation 707 jet with a red and white paint job more TWA-esque in color scheme.","Continuity: When Neal Page and Del Griffith check into their hotel room at the Braidwood Inn, Neal notices that they have to sleep together in a queen sized bed. Yet they wake up in each other's arms sleeping on a twin or full sized bed.","Revealing mistakes: When the L train is coming back to the station at the end of the movie there is an aerial view of the actual train which uses reversed footage. On the ground below you see (very quickly) a person walking backwards.","Errors in geography: Arial shot shows Dell and Neil arriving on the bus into St. Louis by traveling over a Mississippi River bridge. However, they would have been coming from the west, not over the river from Illinois.","Revealing mistakes: Neal's plane ticket claims that he'll leave from JFK Airport, but with the information board in New York and the arrival board in Chicago, Neal is actually departing from LaGuardia Airport.","Errors in geography: When the Semi truck they are riding in approaches Chicago and it shows the skyline, it is showing the architecture of Sears Tower as if looking at it from the Southeast. There is no highway that comes from the southeast, that would be in the lake. Other visible buildings are in fact facing another direction than what they are in the movie.","Continuity: When Neil and Del are on the bus to St. Louis and Neil starts singing, they are clearly driving through an area without trees. But when everyone turns back to look at him they are surrounded by trees and when they go back to Neil and Del, there are no trees to be seen.","Continuity: When Neal first arrives at the Mid-Central Airlines waiting area at JFK Airport, the flight information display (on the wall behind the ticket counter) indicates that Flight 909 is bound for Chicago. A few minutes later, at the Mid-Central ticket counter in Mid Continent Airport in Wichita, KS, the flight information display indicates a destination of \"Nowhere\" for this flight, instead of \"Chicago\", despite the flight still showing as \"delayed\".","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Neal Page and Del Griffith are waiting for their flight in JFK airport, Neal claims that he hailed a cab on Park Ave. in Manhattan, and that Del stole it. It was the attorney who actually hailed the cab, not Neal. Similarly, Del acknowledges that it was Del's cab.","Errors in geography: When driving down the highway, the road has raised reflector dots. Reflector dots are not used in the Midwest because the snow plows would rip them right out of the road.","Continuity: When John Candy arrives to pick Steve Martin up in the semi truck in the end of the movie he has a black eye. There is no scene depicting it or explanation as to why or how he got it. It's never mentioned, but he has it the last 20 minutes of the movie.","Continuity: Outside the Braidwood Inn, Neal tells Del that he has a Visa Card, a gasoline card and a Neiman Marcus Card. However, earlier when they check into the motel, Neal pays with a Diner's Club International card.","Continuity: After Neil yells at Del Griffith in the Witchita motel, it shows Del Griffith sit back down on the bed with the lamp behind him turned on, then it goes to a shot of Neil, but when it goes back to Del Griffith the lamp is turned off","Revealing mistakes: When Neal and Del are driving on the wrong side of the highway a couple in a gray car try to yell to them that they are going the wrong way. They are supposed to be traveling at highway speeds, but close up on the couple clearly shows the car is in park.","Continuity: When the train breaks down Dell is see dragging his trunk away from the train lid side up. Next shot of trunk it is upside-down then right side up and finally when Neal grabs it upside-down again. Dell also has many more people right next to him when Dell grabs the trunk than the immediately preceding shot.","Continuity: Despite his complaints about not being able to change clothes at the end of the film Neal's attire seems to be freshly cleaned and pressed.","Continuity: When boarding the plane in New York, Neal is informed that his seat number is 13C, which is an aisle seat, but in the next scene Neal is seated in the center seat.","Revealing mistakes: On the bus the child running up and down the aisle accidentally conks the woman sitting in the front seat hard on top of her head with the handle of the toy he is playing with. Watch her eyes to see both how startled she was and also, to her credit, how determined she was not to let it show.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Right after Del backs into the motel room, you can see a turn signal showing a left turn on their car, yet in the next scene we see Del using his hand for a turn signal.","Errors in geography: When Del and Neal arrive in Saint Louis by Bus there is an exterior shot of a Trailways Bus Terminal.

(Tiede is an actual Finnish monthly science magazine, and \"Tiedä\" would be a spoof of it.)","Revealing mistakes: In the opening scene, when Captain Pirk shakes the toilet paper off of his boot, the tape used to affix the toilet paper to the boot remains visible on the boot heel.","Revealing mistakes: As Sherrypie announces his surrendering on the telly, you can see the fleet and the explosions have completely frozen behind the window."],"tt0183997":["Revealing mistakes: Twice there appears an animated clip showing about a dozen fully-equipped US troops in gray silhouette marching briskly left to right over a background graphic; however, a close look shows the \"soldiers\" actually wearing narrow-brimmed office-worker-style civilian hats rather than army helmets."],"tt0001463":["Revealing mistakes: When Glinda appears, you can clearly see the actress jerking into position when the harness has stopped pulling her up."],"tt1525784":[],"tt0039324":["Revealing mistakes: Towards the end of the film when Dr Cousins 'punches' Jack Garet, Garet flies backwards without contact."],"tt0037033":[],"tt0033152":["Errors in geography: The Sultan of Basra's palace has many decorations in the form of Hindu iconography, which would be found in India, but not in the ancient Middle East.

But when the executioner raises his sword the next shots of Ahmad show that the rope has disappeared.","Anachronisms: Abu throws tomatoes at his pursuers as he flees though Baghdad.

The speed of light is way too fast to be tracked like that.","Revealing mistakes: When Evie and Rick are running from the flaming balls falling from the sky in the courtyard of the fort, the light is too bright for an overcast day (which we can see that it is from the shots of the sky).","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Imohtep is scared by the cat on the piano, you see the cat's paws hit the piano keys. The last pitch played does not match the corresponding key that the cat stepped on.","Continuity: When the Americans and the British are racing to the City of the Dead, the sun is behind the city. Their shadow goes off to the left, meaning that the sun is to the right of them.

Ancient Egyptians used scrolls. Therefore the Book of the Dead or book of Amun-Ra should not look like modern 'books' at all.","Continuity: In the library, Evelyn drops a book from the top of the ladder, but in the next shot, it is nowhere in sight, and we never hear it hit the ground.","Continuity: When Jonathan is attacked by the insect, Rick rips Jonathan's shirt open and cuts the bug from his shoulder.

When the camera switches to the curator greeting them, Jonathon's hands come into screen as he draws his gun a second time.","Revealing mistakes: When Imhotep throws O'Connell into the group (Evy, Jonathan and Daniels) after consuming Henderson, the actor playing Daniels is clearly a stunt double.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): While Ardath, Rick and Jonathan are trying to dig through a cave-in, Jonathan's accent suddenly switches from English to Scottish when he says \"Come on, put your backs into it!\", then it returns to English for the remainder of the movie.","Factual errors: Both times, when the Arab horsemen are attacking Hamunaptra, the sound of ululation is heard. In the Middle East, this sound is traditionally made by women, and during times of celebration or grieving. It wouldn't be made by attacking men on horseback.","Continuity: When Evie is showing the curator the map that Jonathon found, she points to the bottom right of the map and says \"Hamunaptra.\" Yet when the curator \"burns off the bit with the lost city,\" it is the left side of the map that catches on fire from the lamp.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: After Rick is thrown by Imhotep he says \"no problem\" even though his lips are not moving.","Continuity: When Jonathan goes to start the yellow car, the car is facing away from the direction that they need to go. Within a split second as everyone else is running to get in the car, the car has turned around in the opposite direction. There wasn't enough time to turn the car around between the time that he started the car until the time that everyone else got in.","Continuity: When Evie is on the ladder, she's holding a book that she tries to put on the adjacent bookcase. When she drops the book, there is no sound of the book landing, and when she leans over and the ladder is supporting itself, the book is nowhere to be seen.","Revealing mistakes: When Imhotep is being placed in his coffin and they begin to pour scarabs over him, a few of the CGI scarabs come through the sides of the jar.","Continuity: On the river boat, the window that Evie half heartedly slams closed before brushing her hair has its' hinges on the right and closes on the left. A few seconds later when Rick bursts in, a Medji wielding guns appears in the window which now has hinges on the left and opens on the right.","Errors in geography: The ancient Egyptians believed that there was a strong link between death and the compass direction west (where the sun \"died\" every evening). The fact that the adventurers see the sun rising over Hamunaptra as they approach it suggests that they have been traveling eastwards from the Nile, but if the ancient Egyptians had built a \"City of the Dead\" they would never have built it on the eastern side of the Nile.","Continuity: When Evie steals the Book of the Dead from the Egyptologist, his left arm is around the book and his right arm is around a canopic jar. When he awakes, after Evie has read from the book, the jar is still cradled in his right arm as he sits up, but in the very next shot it is in his left arm with no time at all for him to have moved it there.","Crew or equipment visible: When Rick and Evie are up on deck on the ship, and the deck is empty except for them, and Rick begins checking his guns, a crew member's shadow is visible behind Evie. It appears twice.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: Every time we see Ardath Bey at the beginning of the movie, he says the same phrase every time he talks, even though the translation is always different.","Continuity: When the Egyptologist is running through the streets of Cairo, he is wearing the same outfit that he wore before in the film: a light colored suit, black vest, black patterned tie, gray scarf, and a fez. In the beginning of the film, his fez had a tassel, but when he runs, the tassel is gone. When the mummy kills the Egyptologist and the crowd is around the body, however, the Egyptologist's body has no scarf, tie, vest, or shoes; they are all surrounding the Egyptologist's corpse. The fez is still on his head and has a tassel on it.","Continuity: Any character using the star \"key\" to operate the lock on a sarcophagus in earlier scenes turns it counterclockwise, and yet when used later in the film to open the Book of the Dead (and also the gold book), it is turned clockwise. In addition, whoever operates the \"key\" in each scene always knows which way to turn it on their first attempt, even if they have never seen either the key or the lock before.","Continuity: When the men are at the bar, Mr. Henderson's bangs (hair) first seen as uncombed, but in a second shot, his bangs are combed.","Continuity: When Rick, Evie, Jonathan and the Warden are beginning their first exploration, Rick pulls a gun out of his left holster when Evie informs him of where they stand is the preparation room for \"the after life\". When they are in the hallway and hear the bugs around them, Rick is holding a gun in his left hand and the gun he had drawn before was back in the holster.","Continuity: O'Connell removes the scarab in Jonathan's arm by slicing into the skin, but when the scarab is flung to the ground, it is perfectly clean, without any evidence of the blood or tissue it should have been covered in.","Continuity: When Imhotep kills the last of the Americans, Beni has a considerable amount of stubble on his face and a thicker mustache. When Imhotep corners the rest of the group after they crash the car, Beni has much less stubble and a more defined mustache.","Revealing mistakes: Soon after the main characters pick up their camels, there is a left to right panning shot of them riding in the desert. At least five dust marks on the camera lens are revealed as pale shadows against the sand.","Continuity: When Rick is holding Beni against the wall on the boat, first his hammer is cocked and ready to fire, when it cuts back to Rick, the hammer is down.","Continuity: When Evey is talking to Rick by the campfire, since she's drunk, she tries to kiss him. The angle at which she's leaning changes multiple times. First, she leans to her right, then a different angle shows her leaning the opposite way. These shots alternate until the moment she passes out.","Revealing mistakes: The scarab beetles who attack the digger on the path are floating at the top of the path and some seem to be appearing out of nowhere while others appear running straight out of a solid wall.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Notice the gunshot-wound that one the Americans of O'Connell's entourage has in the car-chase sequence when he is unsuccessfully fighting off Imhotep's followers in the village. He got shot in a scene which was filmed but not shown. (Source: director's commentary on DVD-release)","Anachronisms: When they seek Winston's help, the Victrola is playing at 33 rpm. Victrolas only play at 78 rpm; long-playing (33 rpm) records did not appear until the 1950s.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Seti I, Imhotep, and Ankh-Sen-Amon (spelling varies), are named after real people, but are fictitious characters.","Crew or equipment visible: After Beni is going through the Egyptologist's desk, Rick slams him into a table and a camera flash is visible on the walls behind them.","Anachronisms: In the scene of Thebes, as we see Anck Su Namun enter, the nearest priest of Imhotep is wearing a wireless earpiece which is painted to look like an earring and becomes evident when he turns profile to the audience.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): After Jonathan was able to steal the key of the book of Amun-Ra with Evelyn, he opens the book and reads the hieroglyphics upside down.","Revealing mistakes: It has already been established that some of these beetles/scarabs break out of the golden shells that are part of the decoration on the wall and which allures it's prey. When Jonathan is attacked by the insect, the broken shell disappears as nothing falls away when he holds his hand up.","Revealing mistakes: When Imhotep holds up Rick by the neck, a wire is visible behind Rick holding him up.","Revealing mistakes: During the solar eclipse scenes, the city is surprisingly well lit. A total solar eclipse, as is depicted, would leave the affected area as dark as night rather than the dusk-light that is evident in the movie. After all, it was called the \"plague of darkness\", not the \"plague of reduced visibility\".","Factual errors: Evie's mirror trick for lighting the underground room would only work for a few minutes, at best. The movement of the sun across the sky would necessitate constant corrections in the placement of the mirrors.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When the scarabs are poured over Imhotep, they appear to begin devouring him gradually, a fact which Evelyn later confirms, stating that the beetles devoured a corpse \"very slowly.\" However, whenever the scarabs devour anyone else later on in the film, they do so almost instantaneously.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Evelyn says in the movie that they take out all your organs during mummification including your heart. It is believed that the Egyptians left the heart in the body because it was the seat of intelligence and feelings.","Continuity: When Imhotep realizes Beni is speaking \"the language of the slaves\", he speaks one or two sentences in Hebrew, then switches back to ancient Egyptian.","Continuity: Near the end of the film, in the final fight scene between Imhotep and Rick, Imhotep grabs Rick and opens his huge mouth, but on the shot after Evvie starts reading the spell to make Imhotep mortal, his mouth is open regularly.","Factual errors: When Imhotep addresses Beni in Hebrew, he incorrectly uses a preposition declined for a female addressee. He speaks to Beni as though Beni were female.","Revealing mistakes: When the Americans fighting the Medjai on the boat are shown from the side, one can clearly see that one of the 'cowboys' cocks his revolver and pulls the trigger several times but the gun does not fire.","Continuity: In one of the Hamunaptra scenes, when Jonathan Hyde's character shouts at the workers who then die by pressurized acid, Hyde wears glasses in the first 'yelling' shot, then in the close-ups, he doesn't.","Continuity: When Rick, Evie, Jonathan and the Americans go to the museum and find Ardeth there, John Hannah [/name/nm0001314/] (Jonathan) pulls out his gun twice.","Continuity: Imhotep is seen being buried alive at the beginning of the film. There should be no need for the canopic jars. If they would have removed his liver, lungs, stomach, and intestines (the organs in the jars), he would have been dead at his burial.","Factual errors: When Imhotep speaks to Beni in Hebrew, he says \"Ani uchal lehishtamesh bach\" (\"I could use you\"), but in Hebrew he should refer to Beni as a male and say \"becha\" instead of \"bach\".","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: SPOILER: Imhotep takes the Burns' (the American man with eyeglasses) eyes when he begins to become human again. While Burns is very near-sighted, it's been established that Imhotep doesn't receive the actual organ he steals (if he did, he'd appear to be even more of a patchwork creation). In the novel of the film and script, however, it's been stated that Burns, having poor eyesight, gave his faulty vision to the mummy when his eyes were taken. The concept was furthered in the script when Imhotep uses a pair of spare eyeglasses to fully see Burns and kill him.","Continuity: SPOILER: Near the very end of the movie (just after Imhotep becomes mortal again), O'Connell runs Imhotep through with a very large sword. Imhotep's hands are placed over the wound, then taken away. As he looks at his hands, he sees blood, and the blood has run through his fingers to the backs of his hands. When he places his hands over the wound again, there is no blood visible on the backs of his hands or on his body.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: Cables and pulleys used to pull down the columns are briefly seen when Rick, Evey, and Jonathan are fleeing the destruction of Hamunaptra.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: SPOILER: When Burns is crawling backwards, he says to Evie, \"He took my tongue\" (without a tongue, of course, so it is a throaty vocalization). Still, his lips do not match what he is trying to say.","Plot holes: SPOILER: When Beni is bringing bags of treasure out of the city of the Dead, he loads the bags on camels, yet only five people among the expeditions (O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan, the Warden, and Beni) rode camels. The rest rode horses, with the exception of the Egyptologist, who rode a donkey. The novelization tries to say that these are the French Legion's abandoned camels, but how could those beasts be still alive after 3 years?"],"tt0033576":[],"tt0071589":[],"tt0033021":["Factual errors: The film plays fast and loose with historical fact, most noticeably in the other famous officers who are supposed to have graduated West Point with J.E.B.

As he lurches around to grab his cane, he knocks his top hat off the railing and it lands on the floor next to the waiter. In the next shot, Hyde is holding onto the hat as he lashes out with his cane.","Continuity: When Mr. Hyde and Ivy sit down in front each other in the Variety Music Hall, the objects on the wall behind them change repeatedly between shots.","Revealing mistakes: When Dr. Jekyll is first seen in the mirror, looking directly into the camera, the effect was achieved by filming Fredric March through a hole in the wall framed to look like a mirror. But moments earlier, the trick is revealed when the butler walks past the \"mirror\" but has no reflection.","Continuity: When Dr. Jekyll is making his first portion of the mixture to transform from Jekyll to Hyde the glass is very dirty and you can't see through the glass, but when he lifts the glass in front of the mirror it's perfectly clean.","Revealing mistakes: In the opening scene, as Jekyll looks into the mirror through the subjective camera, his \"reflection\" turns away from the mirror before the camera, (supposedly Jekyll's viewpoint) does.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Miriam Hopkin's character is listed as Ivy Pierson in the end credits.

That's not the way bed warmers were used. They held warm, not red-hot, coals, and were placed in bed before one turned in and removed before the sleeper lay down.

Then when there is a close-up of him taking the rope from the swinging pirate, the rope netting is on his right-hand side, then switches back.

Moments later, the post to her right has no rope wrapped around it or hanging from it.","Revealing mistakes: After Will And Jack commandeer the Interceptor, the ship is viewed from above, sailing on a beam reach (a point of sail in which the boat is at 90 degrees to the wind). When Jack knocks Will off the ship with the boom, he jibes the boat, causing the sail to shift positions suddenly. In order to do this from the previous position, he would have had to turn the ship almost completely around. This would have taken well over a minute. Jack did this in less that three seconds.

Though the pirates can walk underwater and suffer no ill effects, they still jumped when she pretended to drop it because of the instinct to prevent it from being lost. Breathing underwater is not a natural human state, and they likely still think mostly as humans. Furthermore, a tiny piece of gold adrift in the ocean in the middle of the night would not be easy to find, even for the undead.","Anachronisms: The word \"Scallywag\" which is used to refer to a fellow pirate, is in fact only invented in the 19th century (after the American Civil War as a name for white southerners who collaborated during the reconstruction).","Continuity: At the beginning of the movie, when Elizabeth first gets the medallion from Will, the back of it has a spiral design. Later, when the medallion is falling into the chest, both sides are the same.","Revealing mistakes: There are several points during the sword fight in the blacksmith shop where there is an obvious stunt double for Will, such as when he somersaults over the pole - the double has a much higher hairline than Orlando Bloom [/name/nm0089217/].","Anachronisms: \"Bob's your uncle\" the British catch phrase, meaning all will be well or all will be taken care of is thought to refer to Prime Minister Lord Robert Salisbury who appointed his nephew to be Secretary of Ireland in the 1890s.","Continuity: When Elizabeth's hand is cut and her blood is spilt on one of the Aztec Gold pieces; there is an obvious stain on the Aztec Gold piece. When Barbossa picks up the same piece and dangles it in front of Elizabeth, the blood stain is still there...in the next shot of the piece...there is no blood on it.","Continuity: When Barbossa abandons Elizabeth and Capt. Jack on the island, Jack is wearing boots when he dives off the plank, but the boots disappear when he hits the water. The boots reappear when he grabs his sword and pistol and pushes off the bottom.","Continuity: After she puts Jack's coat on him, Anamaria takes her hands off his shoulders twice.","Plot holes: During the battle scene at Isla de Muerta, Commodore Norrington and his men on the rowboats does not hear the gunfire on board the H.M.S. Dauntless. However, when the wounded sailor on board the Dauntless rings the bell, we see a shot of Norrington looking towards the ship then a shot of the ship with gunfire clearly audible and echoing through the night. If it was audible at this point from this distance, then it should have been audible since the first shots were fired and thus Norrington should have noticed them without the need of the bell.","Revealing mistakes: In the battle between the Interceptor and the Black Pearl, grapnels are seen flying through the air, when one clearly snags on a rope in the middle of the shot and stops in mid-air.","Revealing mistakes: At the battle on the Dauntless, when Norrington boards and fights a skeleton, a man can be seen in the background waving his sword. If he was fighting someone, their shadow would've been cast on the ground and visible to us.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: Captain Barbossa, after telling Elizabeth to remove her dress before being deserted at the island, lifts the dress up to his face and says, \"Still warm.\" The pirates are not supposed to feel anything, but it is possible that he was being facetious.","Anachronisms: Both the Interceptor and the Dauntless are painted in the Nelson Checker - black and yellow bands with black port-lids. This scheme dates to Admiral Nelson's command of HMS Victory in 1803. While Nelson's ships were repainted in this scheme it did not become widespread until after the Battle of Trafalgar, 1805. Both before and after this Captains were free to, and did, paint their ships as they saw fit.","Crew or equipment visible: Just as Jack says, \"On deck, you scabrous dogs,\" to the very left edge of the screen over Jack's shoulder is a grip crew member with a tan cowboy hat, white short sleeve tee shirt and sunglasses, just standing there looking out to sea.","Factual errors: In the scene where Jack and Will walk underwater towards the ship they intend to steal, they are holding an upturned rowing boat over their heads to trap air, allowing them to breath. This would be impossible in real life, since not only is the boat made of wood (which floats), but due to the upthrust of the trapped air, Jack and Will would need to weigh several tonnes between them to keep the boat down.","Errors in geography: The chest of cursed Aztec gold, which Cortez was said to have taken from Mexico, depicts four representations of the primary image of the Sun Gate from the Tiahuanaco civilization, outside La Paz, Bolivia.","Anachronisms: HMS Dauntless and HMS Interceptor are shown flying the British Blue Ensign. Prior to 1864, the color of a Royal Navy vessel's ensign was determined by its posting. The color of the Caribbean squadron's ensign was red, as should have been the Dauntless' and Interceptor's (blue was the color of the south Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans).","Errors in geography: When Jack first sails into Port Royal, there is a shot from behind Jack, looking toward the front of the boat, and there is land clearly visible across most of the field of vision. After Jack jumps down, you see him (from a side shot) begin walking toward the back of the boat. The next shot is again looking towards the boat's front from the stern (which cannot be disputed because Jack is completing the strides from the previous shot) and there is no land visible at all.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Jack tears the skirt of Elizabeth's dress off underwater, the loud ripping noise is heard of dry fabric being torn.","Revealing mistakes: When the Pearl is chasing the Interceptor both ships go full wind. Therefore, flags on both ships are flown back as though the ships are propelled by something other than the wind. When a ship is driven by the wind, the flags will be flown in the direction of the wind which in full wind will be from stern to bow.","Crew or equipment visible: When Captain Jack's boat is taking on water, When we first meet him, water splashes onto the camera's lens after he throws water out of the bucket he is using to bail (lower right corner).","Anachronisms: When Will Turner goes to help break out Jack Sparrow from the prison cell at the beginning of the film the bars of the cell are welded together with modern welds not invented until the 19th century.","Anachronisms: When this movie takes place, Nassau Port was known as New Providence. Its name was changed later on.","Revealing mistakes: When Pintel and Ragetti are rowing (dressed as females) towards the Dauntless, Ragetti knocks Pintel's umbrella away. When Ragetti threw his away, he turned into a skeleton progressively, as the moonlight fell on him (meaning that while the umbrella's shade was on half his face, only the exposed half was skeletal.) However, Pintel stays entirely human until the umbrella is completely out of his hands, and then he turns into a skeleton in one frame.","Anachronisms: The British military expression for people to stay away from a place is \"Out of Bounds\" and not the American \"Off Limits\". These are British troops, they would not have said \"Off Limits\".","Revealing mistakes: When Will is knocked out from behind during the assault on Port Royal, the blue pad used to soften his fall is clearly visible over his shoulder as he falls backward.","Anachronisms: Norrington could not have been promoted to Commodore, as this was not a rank in the Royal Navy until 1996. Before then Commodore was simply a Post-Captain commanding a squadron or fleet of ships.","Errors in geography: The Royal Navy did not station any 100 gun ships of the Line in the Caribbean. The ships were simply too large and deep drafted to be of much use in those waters. The English bases in the area were incapable of supporting ships that size. And the Royal Navy only had six such ships world-wide at the time of the film.","Anachronisms: In various close-ups of Barbossa, he can be seen wearing yellow contact lenses.","Anachronisms: All the Royal Navy officers seen are wearing uniforms that would not be introduced until 1747. Norrington's orders were signed 'George R', indicating King George I of England. This dates the film to between 1714 and 1727.","Continuity: In the opening scene Governor Swann approaches young Elizabeth on a crowded deck and asks her to accompany Will. We can see his body being picked up and moved by sailors. In a later shot, we see Elizabeth standing on an empty deck looking at young Will's body laying on the deck.","Crew or equipment visible: In the scene where the commodore and Jack are discussing how to attack the cave and the pearl, the movie pans out to show the two small boats. The boat that has Jack and the Commodore in it, if you look to the right in the water you can view a green divers fin that comes out of the water.","Errors in geography: When the Governor opens Elizabeth's window, we see the point of land from the same angle as Jack sees it standing atop his sinking boat's mast.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: [DVD 2-Disc Edition] In the blacksmith scene when Will says he threatened Elizabeth, Jack replies \"Only a little.\" in one audio version. In another audio track, he says \"Just a little bit.\"","Anachronisms: SPOILER: Jack's execution uses a trapdoor-style gallows. This was not invented until the 1800s.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Jack and Barbossa are fighting, Barbossa plunges Jack's sword into Jack. When it goes in, it is below Jack's leather strap. When we see Jack as a skeleton, the sword is above the leather strap.","Continuity: SPOILER: After Jack has escaped from the gallows with Will, Commodore Norrington comes up to Will and puts his sword onto Will's right shoulder. When we see a close-up of Will, you can see that the blade has switched to his left shoulder.","Anachronisms: SPOILER: HMS Interceptor is blow up when a pirate is seen lighting a trail of gunpowder that leads to pile of gunpowder kegs. The gunpowder that is used is obviously modern smokeless powder as evidenced by it's slow burn rate. Modern gunpowder wasn't invented until 1875 so only black powder would have been available. Black powder 'flashes' and would burn at a rate many times that which was shown.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): SPOILER: At the end of the film Jack is about to be executed. The court crier reads aloud the charges against Jack, and then concludes that he is to be \"hung\" by the neck until dead. Proper English dictates that he would be \"hanged\" by the neck until dead.","Continuity: SPOILER: In the scene near the end when Jack, Will, and Elizabeth are leaving the cave on Isla de Muerta, the chest of Aztec gold has the lid closed. Just before the credits roll and the monkey goes to take one of the gold pieces, the lid is partially open, allowing him to take the gold.","Anachronisms: SPOILER: Shortly after having been rescued from the gallows, in one close-up Jack Sparrow can be seen wearing contact lenses (they were tinted lenses to stop him from squinting).","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: In the scene where Jack is to be hung and the man is reading the list of Jack's offenses, a female extra in a red topped dress is seen mouthing the words along with the man."],"tt0251037":[],"tt0049515":["Anachronisms: Onida wears a pair of trousers with a zipper up the back.","Continuity: The cover on the wagon driven by John Adams varies between shots, having either a small or large overhang."],"tt0047522":["Continuity: When Esther and Norman are in Norman's convertible, , the distance between them keeps changing between shots.","Revealing mistakes: While Vicki and Oliver are talking on the patio as Norman is listening in bed the seascape reflected on the glass doors behind them keeps resetting as though the film loop started over.","Continuity: Vicki and Norman's house is shown, in the distance, as being on top of a bluff overlooking the ocean, but inside the house, it appears that the house is sitting on the beach.","Errors in geography: The terrace outside Esther's Oleander Arms apartment overlooks the twinkling city lights far below, but her address is in the flatlands of Central Hollywood, nowhere near the hills.","Errors in geography: Although the interior of Esther's apartment appears to be situated on a hill with a panoramic view of Hollywood, the address she gives Norman is in the flatlands of Hollywood with, at best, a second story view of nearby buildings.","Revealing mistakes: At the recording session for \"Here's What I'm Here For\", Esther runs across the studio to Norman during the chorus break, whereby a sound man moves his boom mic over to them to pick up their conversation already in progress. However in the playback, their conversation begins at scratch, immediately after the beginning of the chorus break.","Continuity: When Esther and Norman are in Norman's Lincoln convertible, in the closeups the seats have a blanket over the backrest, but in earlier and later shots only the car's standard upholstery is visible."],"tt0037960":[],"tt0023333":[],"tt0045655":[],"tt0427944":["Continuity: When Odette is climbing up the ladder in the beginning during the song, her dress turned from blue and then when the camera comes back on her, it's white with green.","Continuity: During the MoD squad meeting, when Polly takes a bite of the pie she messes the cheese up, but in the next scene it's fine. Also, when Nick sees the cheese on top of the pie it is not melted, but when he pauses to think and stares at the pie, the cheese is clearly melted around the edges.","Continuity: After Heather's article hits the paper, Nick Naylor has a conversation with his son over a glass bottle of Coke. The amount of cola in the bottle increases between shots.","Revealing mistakes: In one of the hospital scenes, Nick is shown with an IV hooked up to a machine on a pole behind him. The machine, however, is actually a tube feeding pump, not an IV pump. There also isn't any tubing on it, or feeding solution, or IV solution.","Continuity: During the MoD meeting, Bobby is shown wearing a tie with a very distinct pattern; in a later shot, his tie doesn't match.","Continuity: In one scene, when Nick is talking to BR, the camera switches from looking at BR to behind BR. When it is looking at BR he doesn't have his glasses on, but when the camera is behind BR, we see he has his glasses on.","Continuity: In the dinner scene with Heather Holloway and Nick Naylor, Heather's glass of wine magically becomes more full.","Continuity: When Nick is testifying before the Senate committee, there is a man in the front row behind him. In the next shot, a woman is sitting in that seat. Then, one shot later, the man reappears.","Revealing mistakes: During the scene where Nick is talking to the press about Heather's article, as the film cuts to Heather Holloway in the office (when she drops the files while watching Nick on TV), the computer monitors on the desks clearly have no cables plugged into them, making the computers on which the other journalists are working useless.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When Billy is describing Heather to Nick he says she has blue eyes. However, when we see Heather, her eyes are brown.","Factual errors: Nick is shown flying from Washington D.C. to Greensboro, NC (the airport serving Winston-Salem) on a wide body jet. No wide body has served this route in the last three decades.","Errors in geography: When the \"Captain\" dies, Nick flies to Winston-Salem NC, to attend the funeral. As the limos are pulling in to the cemetery, you can see the following on the bumpers: TCP-54321. That could only happen in California. The CA Public Utilities Commission issues permits to operate limousines called Transportation Charter Party. Each limo has to have the letters TCP and its individually assigned number on the corners of both front and rear bumpers.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Nick tells Jeff that lighting a cigarette in a space station would cause an explosion because it's an all-oxygen environment. This is only partially correct. In real spaceships, there is a pure oxygen environment but at a reduced pressure (about 5 psi) so there is no danger of run away explosions. The Apollo I incident, where three astronauts died in a similar situation caused by an electrical spark, was a ground test and so the pure oxygen environment was about 15 psi - hence the run away fire.","Continuity: When Polly is arguing with Nick about cigarettes and alcohol, in one shot her hair is tucked behind her ear. Then in the next shot her hair is covering her ear. Then in the last shots of her, Polly's hair is tucked back behind her ear.","Continuity: While speaking to Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre, Dennis Miller comments that he must have the senator's tie pin which is clearly visible. The next two times that the senator is shown, his tie pin is gone. It returns the third time the senator is shown.","Continuity: In the hospital cafeteria when Bobby tries to give Nick the handgun, his finger jumps from inside to outside the trigger guard between shots.","Continuity: When the Academy of Tobacco Studies closes, the sign being dismantled is different from the one shown in the beginning.","Continuity: When Nick is giving the stats of how many people cigarettes have killed, the 1 appears in the millions place before the scrolling numbers hit 999,999.","Factual errors: The lobbyist for the alcohol industry, Polly Bailey, is labeled on the cover of the liquor trade magazine \"Daily Drinker\" as \"Mother Burgandy\" - a common misspelling of \"burgundy\".","Factual errors: Near the end of the movie when tobacco settles with the people of America by paying $256 billion, the courtroom-type picture shown on the screen is actually from the criminal trial of Larry Nevers and Walter Budzyn, Detroit police officers accused of negligence in the death of a citizen in 1992.","Factual errors: During a meeting of the \"MOD\" squad, Polly Bailey, spokeswoman for the alcohol industry asked for advice for her upcoming appearance on \"Dateline\". The spokesman for the firearms industry then asked if Sawyer or Donaldson was going to do the interview. Polly Bailey replied that \"Sawyer\" would be doing the interview. Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson work for ABC. Dateline is on NBC, therefore it would be impossible for Diane Sawyer to interview Polly Bailey on Dateline NBC.","Continuity: When Nick's ex-wife and son visit Nick after the Heather Holloway article, he first talks to his wife from behind his closed door. At this time he has stubble on his face from not shaving. When he answers the door - and for the rest of the scene - he is clean-shaved.","Anachronisms: In the scene where it flashes back to Bobby Jay Bliss's youth it states he tried joining the National Guard days after the 1971 Kent State shootings. However, modern cars can be seen in the reflection of the Military Recruiter's door.","Factual errors: At Nick's press conference in which he addresses Heather's article, in the cut scene with Heather, you see from the window that she is located in a sky-scraper. This is not possible in Washington because of the building height restrictions. Director Jason Reitman points this out during the commentary."],"tt0075456":[],"tt0058521":[],"tt0035152":[],"tt0033029":[],"tt0066451":[],"tt0073623":[],"tt0026966":["Errors in geography: Although the film is nominally set in Nigeria (as shown on the map in Sanders' office), the aerial wildlife shots seem to have been taken in East Africa (e.g. Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika).

Later the wound is seen to be in the front, with no wound visible in the back.","Continuity: The bugs crawling on the block that Frollo holds while talking to Phoebus about the Court of Miracles.","Factual errors: The Festival of Fools takes place at Twelfth Night, on January 6 - the song \"Topsy Turvy\" mentions \"the sixth of 'Januervy'\". But in a later scene, Frollo brings Quasimodo fresh grapes. Grapes are not ripe in January in France.","Continuity: During the \"Out There\" number, when Quasimodo sings \"If I was in their skin\", he is standing over a wall completely in shadow. When he slides down the flying buttress in the very next shot, the wall is brightly lit.","Continuity: Before Quasimodo turns to talk to the baby pigeon, the nest is empty. In the very next shot, the pigeon is clearly visible in the nest, even before it wakes up.","Continuity: When Esmeralda and Quasimodo are about to jump off the top of Notre Dame, Esmeralda ties a kerchief around Djali's eyes and it wraps around the top of his head. In the next shot, however, the kerchief is wrapped vertically, from top to bottom, and it looks much larger.","Continuity: When Frollo gets angry with Quasimodo for helping Esmeralda escape Notre Dame he slams the sculpture of her down on the table close to and on the left side of a candle. In the next shot the sculpture is on the right side and is farther away from the candle.","Continuity: When Quasimodo is desperate to hide Phoebus beneath his table he knocks over the small sculpture of Frollo. In the next shot it is Esmeralda's sculpture that has been knocked over.","Anachronisms: When Quasimodo is seen singing \"Out There\" on the cathedral's roof we can see a set of copper green statues - the 12 apostles - around the central needle. These statues were not added until the XIX century during a general restoration directed by Viollet-le-Duc, a French architect who had read Victor Hugo's novel and was concerned about the possibility of Notre Dame being demolished, as some authorities of the time had considered. Consequently, it would have been impossible to see those statues at the time the movie is set.","Anachronisms: In the movie, Notre Dame is seen with a wide square in front of it. However, during the time the movie is set (XV-XVI century) this square did not exist. It was occupied by the Hotel Dieu, a medieval hospital which was not demolished until the XIX century.","Miscellaneous: At the time of the movie, the use of digital technology to create large crowds of people was fairly new. Thus in many places if you watch the crowds instead of the main characters, you can clearly see how the crowd members all have simple, almost undefined faces and move in very computerized ways. This is especially easy to see at the end of the movie when the little girl pulls Quasimodo into the crowd - watch the crowd that parts for them. Other good examples are just after that when the crowd carries Quasimodo across the square (watch individual crowd members), at the Festival of Fools, and in the shot during the final battle where the gypsies and villagers, moving en mass towards the cathedral, are seen from above.","Continuity: When Frollo picks up a piece of the rail, to make his point about the gypsies, the curved edges of the rail are facing towards him, but in the next shot, when he slams it down, the rail fragment is facing the other way.","Continuity: During the song \"Bells of Notre Dame,\" the Archdeacon's eyebrows change from gray to black.","Continuity: While Frollo is singing \"Hellfire\", he pulls out Esmeralda's sash. At various points throughout the song, the sash disappears and reappears in his hands.","Continuity: In the scene where Phoebus is arriving in Paris and looking for the Palace of Justice, Achilles sits on one of the soldiers and Phoebus cuts off half of his mustache with his sword. However, in the scene where Quasimodo is being tormented at the festival, the focus goes back to the same soldier. In some scenes he has his entire mustache, in other scenes only half.","Anachronisms: All the exterior sculptures on the Cathedral are shown as plain, natural-colored stone. At the time the story is set, they were polychromatic - painted in colors.","Continuity: Frollo does not age at all over the course of the film, even though twenty years have passed from his opening scene.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: Just as Frollo starts scolding Quasimodo for helping Esmeralda escape Notre Dame, he knocks Quasi to the floor. In the next shot, Quasi is seen mouthing something like, \"But I...\", but no sound is heard.","Continuity: During \"Heaven's Light\", Victor's drawing changes from the goat-like claw with a semi-circular line to his final stick figure drawing of Esmeralda.","Continuity: In all the scenes with Quasimodo's model village of Paris, we see additional carvings on the model of Notre Dame, especially on the towers. In some scenes, the additional carvings are visible, and in some, they're not.","Continuity: After Esmeralda and Phoebus meet, Djali the goat smacks him in the stomach.

Preston's squad car he is shown walking on the opposite side of the van. His feet are clearly flat against the floor but in the next cut he is crawling on all fours.","Revealing mistakes: When David is hit by the truck, the blood enters from the side of the screen before the truck hits him.","Revealing mistakes: In Child's Play 3, the entire left side of Chucky's face is removed by a scythe. But when Chucky is sewn back together in Bride of Chucky, it's the right side of his face that was stitched back on.","Continuity: When Tiffany sews Chucky back together, his wounds do not show the injuries from Child's Play 3. Chucky's face was sliced, his arm was torn off, he was shot, his other hand was cut off, and he was pushed into a fan. Instead they show those of the Tommy doll that Chucky beat up and buried in Child's Play 2. So technically, the doll used in this film and Seed of Chucky is Tommy, not Chucky.","Plot holes: The Heart of Damballa that Charles Lee Ray was supposedly wearing on the night he was gunned down wasn't actually in the first movie. The newspaper clipping Chucky shows to Tiffany is in the previous three films but does not show the Heart of Damballa, and in the original where we see Ray gunned down the necklace is nowhere to be found.","Miscellaneous: Tiffany keeps Chucky locked up in a playpen that rolls in and out from under a lid. However, nothing actually attaches the playpen to the lid, so when Tiffany puts a padlock onto the top of the lid to keep Chucky subdued, it technically wouldn't do anything to keep the playpen from rolling out.","Miscellaneous: When the doll Tiffany finishes her makeover and lights her cigarette, the lighter lights itself without her flicking it.","Continuity: The arm that Tiffany gets out of the chest to stick on Chucky has one finger pointing while the others are closed and then when it shows Chucky before it crosses to David shows that all fingers are outstretched yet it is not the type of hand where you can move the fingers manually.","Continuity: After Tiffany gives Chucky the bride doll, she throws rice at his face, the amount of rice on his face changes in between shots","Continuity: When the cop kneels down by the burnt dead Tiffany doll her head is pointing straight, in the next shot it's turned to the side.","Continuity: The skull of Charles Ray Lee was broken off by Jade when she grabbed the necklace.

This is not possible because it is night and there is no light above the airplanes that could cause those shadows. On the contrary, searchlights tried to discover those airplanes from below pointing into the sky. If there was a light above the airplanes strong enough to create shadows, they would be moving much faster.","Continuity: When Susan goes to practice her bow Lucy joins her.

The doors are alternately open and closed in these same shots. In some shots, the train's billowing smoke column disappears entirely.

In a following shot the top edge of the paper can be seen fully intact, then ripped again.","Revealing mistakes: When Susan and Lucy are riding on Aslan's back to the castle, he is traveling at a great speed, but they are sitting upright and their hair is hanging down as if they were sitting still.","Continuity: When Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, Lucy closes the door to the wardrobe, then as Edmund walks into the room the door is shown slightly open, then it is closed again when he goes to open it.","Crew or equipment visible: During the final battle, when one of the centaurs charges the Queen's soldiers, one of the animal soldiers attacks him. When he kills the soldier, a harness is clearly visible as it hoists the soldier up in the air as he falls to the ground.","Revealing mistakes: When Tumnus walks Lucy through the snow to his home, Tumnus should be leaving hoof prints, but leaves James McAvoy [/name/nm0564215/]'s boot prints instead.","Continuity: At the beginning of the battle, Jadis appears from behind the hill with all her troops, stopping close to an upper natural \"step\" in front of her. Later, she orders her bears to move, but we don't see her falling - the step is gone.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): The Pevensies observe blackout rules poorly. They have no blast tape on the windows, no blackout curtains, they open their curtains with the lights on, they leave lights on while they open the back door, etc. Then they are still in the house while the planes are going over. The war sirens went off when planes were spotted a couple of miles from the city itself, so the family should have had plenty of time to get out the house into the air raid shelter. Even though moments of terror make it hard to observe rules, it was precisely this terror that made Londoners obey the rules so strictly.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Lucy closes the spare room door, the sound is of a modern tube latch striking a faceplate. But the door shown has an old-fashioned cupboard latch, which would sound different when closing.","Revealing mistakes: Aslan does not leave footprints when he walks on the beach.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Lucy's mother is pinning the ID to her coat,you hear her say \"You warm enough?\" Her lips move with it, but after Lucy nods, she says \"Good girl,\" but you don't her her mouth move.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When Peter, Susan and Lucy first arrive in camp, the head centaur is blackish dark brown. In later scenes he is chestnut light brown. This could be a seasonal change, part of his biology.","Revealing mistakes: When Susan, Peter, and Lucy are traveling down the river, Lucy begins to fall off the ice. Peter helps her get back on, but Lucy clearly turns into a man wearing a wig.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When the kids and beavers get to the river they go down a ledge and cross. The wolves crossed the top of the frozen waterfall in a matter of seconds. Why didn't the kids and beavers do the same?","Factual errors: The pair of badgers in Aslan's camp make guinea pig sounds. Also, with the exception of Aslan, all the big cats in the film make cougar noises, though none of them are cougars - there are cheetahs, leopards, white tigers, and a lioness.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Peter starts counting for hide-and-seek, you can hear Edmund say \"What?!\". But, his lips aren't moving- he's staring at Peter and Lucy in shock.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: SPOILER: Near the end of the movie, Lucy gives Edmund the potion that is able to heal any wound. His major injuries are healed, but the cuts on his lip and face remain. When Santa gave Lucy the potion, he told her that putting the potion on any wound would heal it. When she gave the potion to Edmund she gave it orally, so it would heal his internal wounds.","Continuity: SPOILER: In the final battle with the Witch, Jadis first stabs Peter through the middle of his sword arm and the grass is green. When the shot is cut back to Peter and Jadis, the sword is only going through the chain mail on the upper part of his arm and the grass is brown.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Peter is fighting the Witch and turns around to see Aslan, he has a cut on his right side of his face, above his eye. The blood had run down past his eye. When Lucy heals Edmund the blood trickle is smaller.","Continuity: SPOILER: When Susan, Lucy and Peter find Edmund lying on the ground (after the battle), Susan is sitting to the side to Edmund's head and proceeds to take off his helmet. In the next shot, Edmund's head is resting on Susan's knee.","Continuity: SPOILER: During the coronation scene after they have all been crowned they sit down on their thrones. Afterwards there is a zoom in on all of their faces, but when they zoom in on Peter's face he is clearly still standing in front of his throne not sitting in it.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: When Aslan jumps at the White Witch just before she can kill Peter, the Witch can be seen starting to fly backwards as if struck before Aslan's front paws actually touch her.","Continuity: SPOILER: During the coronation, Mr. Tumnus places a crown on Lucy's head. The front of the crown rests about 1 inch from her hairline. (Where her hair meets her forehead.) As the shots go back and forth between Lucy and Tumnus the crown gets closer to the hairline, resting just above her forehead and back again.","Continuity: SPOILER: At the beginning of the movie and all throughout Lucy's hair is red. Near the middle of the movie her hair starts getting progressively darker, especially after meeting Aslan at the camp. When she is crowned her hair is completely dark. When they show the older version of her she has red hair and when she falls out of the wardrobe she has red hair. It stays red for the rest of the movie.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): SPOILER: Near the end, Professor Kirke says that one can get into Narnia is only when not looking for it. This was already disproved by Lucy's second entry into the wardrobe, when she went there with Narnia in mind. Every other time the lore holds true.","Revealing mistakes: SPOILER: Toward the film's end, when Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy walk alongside Aslan toward the end of the film in order to be crowned, there is a brief side shot where someone other than William Moseley [/name/nm0608440/] is playing Peter.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: SPOILER: When Lucy first meets Mr. Tumnus, she gives him her hankie, but when she enters Narnia again, Mr. Beaver gives it back to her for him. Lucy may have given Mr. Tumnus the hankie back anytime between the time Aslan revived him and the time Aslan left Narnia, which explains why Tumnus gave the hankie back to Lucy."],"tt0052646":["Continuity: The film ends with the title \"The Head that Wouldn't Die\" instead of \"The Brain that Wouldn't Die\".","Continuity: After Kurt has his arm ripped off by the beast in the closet he stumbles through the house, smearing blood on everything, including the chair in the entryway. However, when the doctor is bringing in his newest \"patient\" she sits in this chair, which is now entirely free of blood.","Revealing mistakes: At the end of the movie, it is obvious that the monster's mask is tied in the back.","Continuity: During the \"Body Beautiful\" contest, the MC announces that there are five finalists, but he only brings out four.","Revealing mistakes: At the end of the film in the killing of the doctor by the monster, the latex skull cap on the monster is ripped and hanging loose and you can see Eddie Carmel [/name/nm0138350/]'s hair underneath!","Revealing mistakes: Kurt's arm is visible as a lump under his jacket after the monster is supposed to have pulled it off","Revealing mistakes: After Bill leaves the strippers' changing room and the blonde stripper slaps the brunette stripper, the close-up of the slap shows an extremely hairy male arm that clearly does not belong to the blonde stripper.","Continuity: After places the body of Kurt in a lying down position, Dr. Cortner moves to the left side of the screen/lab to make drinks. After closing the bottle of poison, he picks up the two glasses and he is now on the opposite side of the lab. There also appears to be a sheet over Kurt's body (at the very least his lab coat is in a different position than he was left).","Continuity: Before the brunette stripper is slapped, she is seen taking off her white glove, yet when she is slapped and she puts her hand to her face her glove is clearly back on as if she never took it off.","Continuity: Dr. Coltner is about to perform his final operation. He places some tape over Jan's mouth and has surgical gloves on. Then he walks around to the body he is going to operate on and he sterilizes his hands (no gloves), then his gloves are back on again as he is ready to operate.","Continuity: When Dr.Cortner is in the back room of the stripper bar talking to the blonde stripper, there is a large mirror in the background with five photographs attached to the left side. But when the brunette stripper enters the room and begins to fight with the blonde stripper, there are now nine photographs attached to the mirror, five on the left, and four more in the center of the mirror.","Continuity: When Dr.Cortner finds Kurt dead in the laboratory, the doctor is shown loosening his necktie as he walks away from Kurt's body toward Jan. The camera angle then changes to a close-up of the doctor looking at Jan, and the doctors necktie is now tight. In the next shot the doctor walks back over to Kurt, and the doctors necktie is loose again.","Continuity: When the doctor is sitting visiting the blonde stripper, to his back is a bare wall with two hanging cats and to his left is a wall with flowered wallpaper and a huge mirror with photos. When the brunette stripper comes in she stands in front of the mirror. Words are exchanged and the doctor leaves. More words are exchanged and the blond slaps the brunette. Not only does the brunette have the bare wall behind her now, the cats have changed position as well.","Continuity: After the doctor has covered up the body of Kurt, he goes to the closet and shuts the little peep door. His sleeves are neatly buttoned. He shuts the door with his right hand and it shows that his sleeve is unbuttoned and rolled up twice. After he shuts the door, his sleeve is buttoned back up again.","Continuity: When Dr. Cortner is sitting on the sofa talking to the blond stripper, and the brunet stripper enters the room, two chairs can be seen in the room, one is to the right of the sofa, and one in front of the mirror. However in the next shot as the brunet stripper walks in front of the sofa the two chairs are gone. Then one chair reappears under the mirror when the strippers drop to the floor and start to wrestle.","Continuity: When Doris finally agrees to go with Dr. Cortner for a consultation, we see her walk toward the phone wearing a robe with long sleeves. However, in the next shot her left arm (the only part of her body that is visible) is completely bare, as she picks up the phone, and then hangs it back up.","Continuity: When the doctor and the blond stripper enter the back room, there is a coat rack with the 'feathers' that the stripper uses in her act just to the left of the sofa. When the brunette stripper comes in, the coat rack is still there but after the doctor leaves and the two strippers drop to the floor and have their \"cat fight\", the coat rack has disappeared.","Continuity: When the doctor loses control of his car and is thrown out, he rolls down a steep hill. He sits up and sees the burning wreckage of his car. He gets up and staggers over to it. Except he runs on down the hill instead of back up the hill where he should have.","Continuity: The doctor and the two strippers are in the back room talking. Just before the doctor gets up to leave, in three quick shots, the brunette's hair goes from over her right shoulder, behind her right shoulder and back over again.","Continuity: After \"the thing in the closet\" has burst out and bitten the chunk out of the doctor's neck, he pushes him down. Even with a hefty push, the doctor wouldn't be any further than the center of the room. But the next shot has both the doctor on the floor and the thing standing over him all the way across the room next to Kurt's body.","Continuity: When Dr. Cortner is shown picking up the two probes that are used to stimulate the patients brain, the doctor has rubber gloves on his hands. But in the next shot as the doctor touches the probes to the patients brain, the doctors rubber gloves have disappeared.","Continuity: In the close-up of Kurt holding his withered hand close to his body, the one button on the front of his lab coat that is visible is a light color (B&W film), but in the next wide-angle shot the buttons on his lab coat are a dark color.","Continuity: When Dr. Cortner is thrown from the car, he rolls to the bottom of the hill. When he sits up his necktie is twisted to the right and up over the right shoulder of his jacket.

However, the windows are shut as seen in earlier and again in later shots.","Continuity: In the close-up of Kurt holding his withered hand close to his body, the cuffs on his lab coat are the type that have buttons, and both cuffs are unbuttoned. However, in the next wide-angle shot, the cuffs on his lab coat are the type without buttons.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Dr. Cortner and Jan are driving to the country house he loses control of the car and crashes, but we hear the brakes screeching before the Dr. puts his foot on the brake pedal.","Continuity: When Dr. Cortner goes to see Doris, she is finishing up a photo shoot. He sits down on the right side of the sofa. A customer comes up to her to ask about a private photo shoot. The camera is centered on them but you can see Dr. Cortner in the background. In three shots the Dr. switches from the right side of the sofa to the left and then back again to the right.","Continuity: Throughout the dressing room scene at the stripper bar, the blond stripper has a bracelet on her right wrist, but near the end of the scene when she is on the floor wrestling with the brunette, the bracelet is on her left wrist.","Factual errors: Common sense will tell you that when somebody is performing an operation (say, an open heart surgery, or more specifically, in the film they're performing an operation to stimulate the patient's brain) the doctor(s) will get blood on them. Amazingly, Dr. Cortner comes out of the operation room spotless, as do the other doctors and nurses as well as the patient.","Continuity: When Dr. Cortner approaches the crashed car being consumed by fire, he is confronted by a male hand (note the hairy wrist) which drops from sight when the touches it. The car's occupant is supposed to be his girlfriend, Jan (a woman).","Factual errors: When they are operating in the first scene it is really obvious they not really cutting anything.","Continuity: When Cortner is in the stripper bar, we see a party of people get out of their booth and leave, and Cortner sits there. When he gets up to go into the back room, there's a cutaway shot of that same party of people sitting in the booth again.","Continuity: Bill prepares drinks for him and Donna and puts a drug in her drink which he holds in his left hand.

When he jumps against the wall, you can see many dark footprints, from previous takes.","Factual errors: When Troy and Chad push the broken lorry home, we can see liquid steaming out from the engine. Troy says that the fuel pump is broken, but they replace the radiator's missing stopper. An engine with a broken fuel pump won't run at all. A broken water pump would make it overheat.","Crew or equipment visible: When the basketball team first get the trophy, the cameraman and some of the crew are reflected in the basketball on the trophy.","Continuity: As \"Rocketman\" talks to Troy just before home room, his hair changes (in front of face, away from face, in front again) between shots.","Continuity: Troy gets green paint on his hands, then climbs over the white fence without getting green paint on it.","Continuity: In the yearbook room, Troy is wearing Converse sneakers. In the next scene, at lunch, he is wearing Vans.","Revealing mistakes: Kelsi's necklace is backward in one scene, revealing the clear tape used to keep it in place.","Continuity: When Tiara is at Sharpay's locker, she holds out the pink shopping bag with her left hand. In the next close-up, it's in her right hand.","Continuity: When Troy and Gabriella are dancing on the roof, the back of Gabriella's dress, just under her hair, is ripped. You can see the difference in a later scene.","Revealing mistakes: When Sharpay closes her locker, the interior lights stay on.","Revealing mistakes: The trees have full summer leaves at the party after the basketball game. The weather would be much colder on a night after a basketball game in Albuqurque.","Continuity: In the graduation dance scene when Chad drops the basketball and it rolls behind him, we quickly see Troy reach down and pick it up. In the next shot Troy is dancing with Gabriella and the ball is gone.","Continuity: In the scene where Troy asks Gabriella to the prom on the school's roof, they waltz to \"Can I Have This Dance\". Throughout the musical number, the daylight switches back and forth from early morning sun to evening sunset several times, suggesting that the filmmakers spent all day shooting this scene and edited together the best bits, although clearly filmed at different times of day and causing a disjointed feel.","Continuity: When Troy and Chad arrive at the junk yard, Troy gets out of the truck and you can see he has on light blue boxers. When they start singing his boxers change to navy blue or black.","Continuity: When Troy and Gabriella are in the tree house, Gabriella's dress switches from having the third button buttoned and unbuttoned.","Revealing mistakes: In \"Right Here, Right Now\" you can see the lining of the blue screen which shows the trees and sky on it.","Continuity: In the final scene when Chad and Taylor come up to dance he has a basketball in his hands. When it gets knocked out of his hands Troy picks it up but a split second later it is not in Troy's hands anymore, and Troy has his hands around Gabriella.","Continuity: At the beginning of the graduation ceremony scene all the students are seen standing as Troy gives his speech; in the next shots they are then seen sitting on white chairs and then when the final song starts it switches back to them standing, the chairs have disappeared.","Revealing mistakes: Even though it is presumably May or June (around the time of graduation), in the scene where Coach Bolton confronts Troy about Julliard, you can see the breaths of both actors.","Continuity: During Troy's house party, a shot of Kelsi DJing is directly followed by a shot of a group dancing, with Kelsi in the middle.","Continuity: While Gabriella is pleading to the group to do the musical, a clipboard with a pen is facing left to right on the screen, in the next shot of Gabriella, the clip board is facing towards Gabriella.","Continuity: While Kelsi is trying to get the group to do the musical, Gabriella is talking to Ryan, the next shot, she is facing the other direction.","Continuity: In the basketball game, Troy's hair goes from being very sweaty to almost dry in just a few seconds. It goes back and forth several times.","Revealing mistakes: When Ryan joins Kelsi in the music room during \"Be With You\" he looks at a piece of sheet music before sitting down and playing the song on the piano. However, this sheet music shown is only a vocal score and has no piano chords written on it so there is no way Ryan would've known how to play the song.","Continuity: When Troy is on the roof talking to Gabriella over the phone, there is nothing behind him. When Troy and Gabriella are both on the roof, there is a green house and plants.","Continuity: During \"A Night To Remember\", Chad walks through the dressing room doors twice.","Continuity: When Rocket man comes off the bench, he is taking off his white warm up suit. While he runs to the huddle he is taking off his warm up jacket. When he gets to the huddle he is tossing his warm up jacket, but he warm up pants are also off.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: The drama teacher Ms. Darbus tells Troy to turn out the lights and to lock up. Any teacher would see that the student departed and see that the building was properly locked up. However, Ms. Darbus has great trust in Troy, and also knows his father works at the school. She trusts that Troy would lock up.","Continuity: During the \"I Want It All\" singing with Sharpay and Ryan (Before Ryan sang it in the play), Sharpay is seen wearing a white jacket (Towards the end) over her white dance outfit. As she enters the cafeteria-scenery again, the jacket disappears, without anyone having enough time to remove it from her (merely a second or two later).","Factual errors: Basketball teams of all levels are required to have no more than 12 players on the team. During the musical, when the basketball players are singing \"Last Chance,\" we see twelve basketball players. Troy hadn't yet arrived, and Rocketman was an Understudy (Meaning he wasn't an actor in the play originally). As well, no one is playing Troy or Rocketman, as no 14 or 41 are visible (Troy and Rocketman's numbers, respectively). This means the school either has more players than are legal, or two random actors were thrown into this part (Although, they would have expected Troy to be there, meaning that this is still an error; Troy's absence would cause an even larger error in choreography, since there would be no one taking his place).","Continuity: In the scene where Sharpay tells Troy about Gabriella's acceptance to Stanford, there are giant letters spelling \"Wildcats\" painted on the row of lockers. Later, during the song \"Walk Away\", when Troy goes to his, locker the giant letters have mysteriously vanished. They reappear when Troy dances throughout the school during the song \"Scream\".","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): Throughout the movie, Troy keeps complaining about a new fuel pump for his truck. Fuel Injected systems with fuel pumps where not common until the late 1980s. His being an older truck (1960s Ford) would have most likely had a carburetor, not a fuel pump.","Factual errors: When Troy and Gabriella are walking to the house you see Troy holding a yellow English book for 11th graders, not 12th graders. The only way he would have this book is if he failed that class last year, meaning he is either taking two English classes, or he is going to summer school his senior year.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Ryan and Kelsi sing the beginning of \"Be With You\" you can clearly see that they are both singing the lyric \"Even if we're miles apart\" even though you can only hear Ryan singing until \"miles apart.\"","Continuity: (At 1:34:00) Sharpay and her assistant were dancing on the stage. One of the guys on the right side of the screen was standing a little taller than the rest of the male crews. A second later, he was standing in the same height as everyone else.","Continuity: SPOILER: Both Gabriella and her mother are seen moving away from their house in Albuquerque, and Troy and Gabriella drive back together without her mother for the musical.

When the Phantom is leaving, the veil is back on the mannequin, and then is gone when Meg walks past.","Crew or equipment visible: During Christine's first visit to the Phantom's lair, the shadows of the camera and camera crane are visible on her and the Phantom as he crosses in front of her at one point.","Revealing mistakes: When Christine is visiting the cemetery, we see her pass the same set of tombstones (most notably a small stone with an iron fence and a much larger one shaped vaguely like a bed) from three or four different directions before she finally reaches her father's tomb.","Continuity: When Meg steps out of the underground river and into the Phantom's lair, her brown pants are clearly soaked with water; a few moments later, when she finds the Phantom's mask in the bedchamber, her pants are perfectly dry.","Continuity: Christine's hair is wild while running up the staris in \"Why have you brought me here...\" and then on the roof her hair is pulled back.","Crew or equipment visible: During the chandelier scene, when the camera pans on the audience rushing out of the theater, several crew members are visible in street clothes in the top left corner.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: During the beginning of the \"Masquerade\" scene the singers lips are not matched to the music.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: At the end of \"Music of the Night\" as the Phantom is laying Christine into her bed, his mouth and the audio are unsynchronized.","Revealing mistakes: When the Phantom does not wear his mask, you can see that the right side of his face is disfigured, including his right eye. But when he's wearing his mask, the right eye can be seen anyway - and it's not disfigured.","Continuity: The last letter that is read in the \"Letters\" scene does not match the letter that the Phantom is seen to be putting in the envelope. In addition, the text on the letter is obviously too short to match the words that are read by Firmin and spoken by the Phantom.","Revealing mistakes: After Raoul swims up to take his breath while trapped under the grate, the iron grid is show dropping into the water. However, the bubbles travel downwards, showing that the shot was reversed.","Continuity: When Christine lights a candle for her father in the chapel after \"Think of Me\", she lights her match from another candle. However, when the shot switches to over her shoulder, the candle she lit is the only one burning.","Continuity: At the beginning practice, when the phantom drops the background on Carlotta, he drops a letter down. When it falls down, it is a pure white envelope with the red emblem. When Madam Giry picks it up, the lines on the envelope are outlined in black with the red emblem.","Revealing mistakes: The rope that the Phantom cuts and causes the chandelier to crash is hanging limp when it is tied to the rail on the stage, which means that when it was cut it would only probably hang there. If it really was the rope keeping the chandelier suspended then it would be taut because of the weight.","Continuity: When Christine is in the boat and being shown around the Phantom's lair for the first time, the lock of hair over her left shoulder changes from being very curly to wavy in between shots.","Continuity: During the \"Point of No Return\" reprise, the Phantom places the veil on Christine's head. When the camera pans from her face to his, we can clearly see the back of her head, and there is no veil, but when the camera pans back to her it is there again.","Continuity: During the Masquerade scene, when the phantom comes downstairs, he has not got the bag with the Don Juan Notes in his hand, but when he arrives at the bottom of the stairs, he throws the bag with the notes on the floor.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: During \"Prima Donna\" Carlotta's lips do not match the words being sung.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When the Phantom takes Christine down to the catacombs for the first time, her hair and makeup slowly change from being simple and understated, to more sophisticated and womanly. The director has stated that this was deliberate and that the change in Christine's appearance during this scene was intended as a metaphor to representing her sexual awakening.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: In the semi-beginning of 'Music of the Night' the Phantom's mouth comes in too late for the words when he saying \"Live as you've never lived before.\"","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When the phantom takes Christine down to his lair and places the veil on her head, saying \"an eternity of this before your eyes\" his mouth does not match the words.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Raoul runs to Christine and says \"Are you alright\", we hear her say \"Raoul we're not safe here\" but her mouth does not move.","Continuity: When the Phantom is on the rooftop after Christine and Raoul leave, you can clearly see the Phantom' footsteps in the snow. Notice how Christine's and Raoul's have disappeared, even though they were just there.","Continuity: During the point of no return scene, when the phantom grasps Christine's wrists, the gold bracelet become unclasped. Yet when the camera view switches, the bracelet is secured and in place.","Anachronisms: At the beginning of the movie, we see that the \"current\" year is 1919. Just before the Masquerade party scene, it shows us the old Raoul staring out of the car window at a couple looking at jewelry. The window says Swarovski and shows the swan logo underneath. While Swarovski was indeed around in 1919, the original logo was an edelweiss flower. The company did not adopt the swan for their logo until 1988, nearly 70 years after the events of the movie.","Revealing mistakes: During the chandelier scene, the crowd is running and you can see the knee pads on the women when their dresses come up.","Revealing mistakes: When the Phantom is on the rooftop after Christine and Raoul leave, You see the Phantom's cape blowing in the wind. If you look closely, you can actually see that there are two capes blowing in the wind, one under the other. This is due to the fact that the film editors added a digitally created cape to blow in the background, but for whatever reason, did not match its movements with the real cape the Phantom was wearing.","Miscellaneous: During \"Music of the Night\", when the Phantom is carrying the fainted Christine towards the bed, Christine's head accidentally hits the large tassel on a nearby curtain.","Revealing mistakes: When Christine is walking through the cemetery, you can't see her breath even though it is cold enough to be snowing.","Revealing mistakes: During Christine's first performance, once the audience appears, if you slow the video down, you can clearly see that the actors in the very back left of the theater are legless mannequins with cloth thrown over the tops.","Continuity: In the \"Masquerade\", Christine and Raoul are dancing and they have their masks in their hands. However, when the camera changes its angle, the masks disappear, and then again reappear.","Continuity: Throughout the entire \"Music of the Night\" sequence the slit on Christine's nightgown changes from her right side to the center. This continues on up through \"Stranger Than You Dreamt It.\"","Crew or equipment visible: During the mirror scene, you can clearly see Madame Giry in one of the mirrors waiting for her cue, just before the rope drops down from the ceiling.","Continuity: When Christine and Raoul kiss on the rooftop, he picks her up and spins around. During this, her hand is on the back of his head, but when the camera goes in for a closer shot, her hand is around his neck.","Continuity: When Meg goes to look for Christine after she sings 'Think of Me', she walks backstage and passes Monsieur Firmin and Monsieur Andre and stops at the hallway. Then when the camera switches over to the new managers, Meg walks past them again, even though she just went down a hallway.","Continuity: During the \"Point of No Return\" scene, the Phantom is clean-shaven. In the following scene in the Phantom's lair, he clearly has a five o'clock shadow, even though the progression of the story is merely minutes.","Revealing mistakes: In the scene of \"Don Juan\" it shows a birds eye pan over of the audience in the ground level (orchestra seating). The people in the back few rows are not people but figurines of head and torso, they do not have legs.","Continuity: While Meg is congratulating Christine after her \"Think of Me\" performance, she puts her hand on Christine's shoulder and then takes if off.

When she gets there it is completely straight.","Continuity: When Raoul is on his way down the stairs to the phantoms lair, he falls through a hole, down into a pit of water. Iron bars then lower from above, but since the character fell straight down into the water, it would be physically impossible for the bars to be there.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: At the beginning of the movie text appears to tell us that the main story takes place in Paris in 1870. But, the Garnier Opera house was in the midst of construction due to Franco-Prussian War.","Continuity: At the end of \"Prima Donna\", right before the opera starts, on La Carlotta's left shoulder there are 4 random shapes, but after the Phantom makes his dramatic entrance only 3 shapes are shown - and they are larger than the original 4.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: When The Phantom brings Christine to the lair, she is wearing stockings. However once she faints and the scene shifts to the Joseph Bouqet scene and then back to the lair, they are mysteriously missing. One explanation for this, however, is that the phantom simply took the liberty of removing Christine's stockings while she was unconscious.","Continuity: During the Mirror scene, Christine's eyes have no make-up on them.

While performing in the opera, he wears a black mask covering his face from above his eyebrows to his cheek. With these masks, there is no part of his deformity that is visible. When the phantom's face is revealed, his deformities extend from above the hairline to his jawline and he is missing a significant amount of hair on the right side of his face. Neither mask would be able to sufficiently cover his deformities.","Incorrectly regarded as goofs: During \"Point of No Return\" when Christine removes the Phantom's mask, his hair goes from being slicked back and even to messy and loose. However, you can clearly see the wig being pulled off of his head as she unmasks him. Additionally, in the scene just prior to the start of Don Juan and Point of No Return, you see the Phantom adjusting his wig. Several additional wigs can be seen on the table before him as well,","Continuity: During the Scene on the rooftop, the Phantom picks up the rose that Christine dropped and slowly tears the petals off in his hand.

However, even if Raoul was still the Vicomte, Christine would have died as the Vicomtess de Chagny, but her gravestone describes her as the Countess. Either Raoul is the Comte and Christine was the Comtesse (Countess) or Raoul is the Vicomte and Christine was the Vicomtess - you cannot mix and match the titles.","Continuity: When Madame Giry reads the Phantom's first letter, she then gives it to Richard Ferman, he proceeds to rip it up.

The jolts to the spacecraft riding on top would be minimized with the use of giant shock absorbers. This would have been far more interesting to portray than the standard \"glow at the back\" movie propulsion system.","Revealing mistakes: When they show the astronauts going to intercept the comet, they all wearing golf shirts and not official NASA shirts. It looks like they forgot to buy the correct uniforms.","Factual errors: The comet is depicted as nearly white when in reality comets are among the darkest objects in the Solar System, normally reflecting about 3% of the light that hits them (in comparison, Earth reflects about 39%). The movie producers were aware of this fact, but special effects technology of the time made it extremely difficult to depict a black object against black space.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): At the beginning of the movie Leo says the unknown object (which would later turn out as the comet) is \"about 10 degrees south\" of some stars he recognized. If it were 10 degrees away he wouldn't have seen it. What you can overlook with a telescope while looking at one place would be only a tiny fraction of a degree.","Plot holes: The massive Messiah is constructed secretly in low-earth orbit. In reality, its construction would be virtually impossible to hide from satellite astronomers.","Errors in geography: The direction of the wave varies in several shots during the New York destruction sequence. Examples: - When the wave hits the Statue of Liberty it is observed coming from behind it, which in reality would have been coming from the Jersey City side. The problem is that that the wave would be coming from a northwesterly direction as it is shown. The wave was really supposed to be coming from the southeast. So the wave should have hit the front of the statue instead of the back. - When the wave reaches Washington Square Park. (The Washington Square arch is actually on the uptown side of the park, while the wave should be coming from farther downtown. But it makes for a nicer shot that way.) - In the overhead shot of the Chrysler Building the wave is shown impacting it directly from the east whereas it should have been coming from a more southernly direction. - The head of the Statue of Liberty and the debris is shown advancing underwater by the current in a southeasterly direction on Wall Street even though the wave came from that direction.","Factual errors: After a press conference, a copy of Newsweek magazine is shown with a glossy, shiny cover. Newsweek's cover is never glossy.","Continuity: When Leo Biederman picks up the motorcycle in the Hotchner's home at the end of the movie, the left-hand mirror is twisted the wrong way; however, when Leo takes off, the mirror is correctly set.","Continuity: When Sarah and Leo are on the motorbike making their way away from the comet, the comet is shown moving perpendicular to the freeway they're on. Then, just after that it passes Sarah's parents going in a parallel direction.","Continuity: On the newscast, they say that the warheads will be drilled 100 meters into the comet; however, while on the comet, the astronauts are working with measurements in feet, including the bomb being drilled 800 feet, which is actually over 290 meters, into the comet.","Continuity: When Jenny is calling a cab, talking to her father in the rain, she raises her left hand, but in the next shot her right hand is up.","Revealing mistakes: When Jenny gives up her seat on the helicopter, the shot pans out and shows 20 or more helicopters in the air. A few seconds later the camera does a 360 around Jenny, there are no helicopters in the air.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When the Messiah is approaching the comet to land on it and Jenny Lerner is reporting on the ship's progress, she mentions that the ship will be entering the comet's \"tail, or coma\" (implying that the tail and coma are the same thing). In fact, the coma of a comet, along with the nucleus, actually form the head of the comet. The coma and the tail are two completely different parts.","Factual errors: When the President is addressing 'The Nation' on live TV from The White House, he steps away from the lectern and its 2 microphones, to illustrate the course of the comet on a TV monitor away to his left. At this distance, and without a lapel microphone (radio or wired), his voice would not have been picked up by the lectern microphones and would have faded away to a muted level. Not what the White House Press Office would have allowed nor would have planned for.","Anachronisms: In the last attempt to stop the comet, the United States fires Titan ICBMs. However, the Titan series of ballistic missiles have been out of service since 1987 when the final missiles were stood down. And where was the \"Messiah\" when all these Titan warheads were detonating near the comet?","Errors in geography: The President announces the wave reached the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, yet Leo and Sarah manage to avoid it by racing to the top of a hill just over 6 miles from Virginia Beach.","Factual errors: Astronauts not wearing \"Snoopy Cap\" communications carrier during EVA. A \"Snoopy cap\" is a brown and white fabric communications cap dating back to the Apollo days that incorporates a pair of earphones and microphones, allowing the EVA astronaut to communicate with both the crew members in the spacecraft and ground controllers in Houston, as well as minimizing flyaway hairs.","Factual errors: We are told that Wolf was blown \"into a million pieces\" and that the fragments entering the atmosphere \"lit up the sky for over an hour\". Ignoring the accuracy or lack thereof of \"a million pieces,\" the effect of that much mass entering the atmosphere would have been far from harmless. While they may have been smaller, they would not be traveling any slower when they entered the atmosphere. Any pieces big enough to get any distance would create an ionization trail resulting in a 20,000-degree jet of flame shooting up the piece's trajectory. Most damaging, however, would have been heating caused by atmospheric friction as all those pieces descended into the atmosphere. This would have generated millions of kilowatts and heated thousands of cubic miles of the upper atmosphere to at least the temperature of a pizza oven, cooking any exposed ground below it.","Factual errors: A meteor, the size of one mile enters the atmosphere, loses most of its speed, rushes over the head in a rather slow motion and makes hardly any noise and wind? Considering the entry speed of more than 20 miles/sec the shock wave of that would have blasted all away but no significant wind is blowing. The heat wave would probably have vaporized those people on the highway in a split second. Then, as the meteor heads for open sea, it suddenly picks up enormously in speed! How can that be?","Errors in geography: When Sarah's mom tells Leo she is up on the hill, the camera pans to a mountain top hill overlooking a huge valley. Richmond is a one hour drive from the nearest Mountain-like hills. Even then, the mountains in Virginia are completely covered with trees. It is obviously somewhere in Southern California.","Factual errors: It would not be possible for the helicopter to take a full load of people to higher ground and then to the Ark from Washington, D.C. without stopping for fuel.","Continuity: Near the end, Oren holds his right hand up to the monitor that is showing his wife and child, however, when the view pans to face Oren, he now has his left hand up.","Plot holes: The time pressure on the Messiah crew was unrealistic. In a mission of that many months' duration, a few hours would not make a difference. They could easily have waited a mere seven hours for the return of darkness, so as to safely finish placing the last bomb.","Plot holes: The Messiah's trajectory was not realistically (or intelligently) chosen. They could have easily flown up beside, or even to the front of, the comet's head, rather than insisting on landing on the night side (and flying upstream into a cloud of rocks).","Factual errors: At the star party where Leo first sees the comet, he and Sarah use a white-light flashlight to consult their charts. Red-filtered lights are used instead, to avoid wiping out the eyes' dark-adaptation.","Factual errors: In the interior shots of the spaceship, there is a huge amount of space - there is no way any spaceship would be built with that amount of space, as it needs to supposedly carry food and water for 10 months. The spaceship also has a lot of steel girders in its construction - far too heavy to be used.","Errors in geography: During the traffic scene, a highway information sign shows Interstate 66. I-66 is in Northern Virginia (where the scene was filmed). Interstate 64 is the highway that runs from Richmond to Virginia Beach.","Plot holes: When the Titan missiles are launched in a last-ditch attempt to destroy the comet, we are told that the comet is 14 hours from impact, and that the Titans will detonate in 20 minutes. Since the comet is moving at 26 miles per second, that puts it over 1 million miles from the Earth, and there is no way that the missiles could reach it in that time.","Revealing mistakes: (At 1:44:12) When looking at the Virginia Beach sign the wrecked bronze car's tail lights have been removed.","Plot holes: At the beginning, it is the astronomy professor that first notices the comet, not Leo, at the astronomy outing, when he says to Leo, \"...And the one (light) below that?\"; therefore, the astronomy professor should have had been able to have it named for him, along with Prof. Wolf.","Revealing mistakes: Professor Wolf's jeep blows up before it impacts anything of significance, and what is more, the explosion comes from inside the passenger compartment and not the gas tank rupturing.","Continuity: When Jenny is interviewing Rittenhouse on the dock, the position of the sun drastically changes several times in only three minutes.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Tanner is talking with Monash after Monash was injured, Monash says \"...and I see myself dreaming,\" but his lip movements are something different.","Factual errors: During the first scene at the Star Party, Anybody who has ever actually been to a star party knows that a white flashlight is taboo. It should be a dim, red light to protect your night vision.","Crew or equipment visible: During the President's continuation of life broadcast, there is a shot in the NBC Studio wide shot where you see everyone watching the line of network TVs, in the bottom left corner of the frame you see a Film camera dollying forward. It would be an unnecessary angle for a Studio camera.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Orrin is talking to Fish after he is stricken blind, the scene where Fish is preparing to read Orrin Moby Dick, Orrin's lips move an the visual is obviously delayed at one point.","Continuity: In the photos showing Jenny as a little girl on the beach her father looks exactly the same as he does in the present.","Revealing mistakes: A threat this big with thousands of people working on space and cave projects could not possibly be kept secret for a week, much less a year.","Revealing mistakes: Close to the end of the movie, Leo is watching a certain cable-only channel (MSNBC) at the back of a truck with about a dozen farm hands on a portable TV that only picks up signals over the air."],"tt0056026":[],"tt0073092":["Anachronisms: The herald information for the railroads painted on the boxcars after the last big fight scene are 1960's vintage rather than the era the movie suggests.","Anachronisms: Cheney rides into town at the beginning of the film on a train pulled by a diesel electric locomotive that did no exist at the time the film is set. Later Speed and Cheney ride back to New Orleans on a steam train that would be correct for the time.","Anachronisms: Bronson smokes a filtered tipped cigarette. Filters were not used on cigarettes until the early '50s.","Factual errors: When Chaney shoots up Pettibon's \"place\", he fires 8 shots from a revolver which only has 5 or 6 chambers.","Continuity: While Speed is waiting for Chaney on his balcony reading the track listings he is wearing his shirt. The next scene is when he hears the door bell he's not wearing his shirt that is draped over the chair.","Anachronisms: Not only are the heralds seen painted on the boxcars from the 1960's, the boxcars, themselves, are of a design type dating from the 1950's and later."],"tt0056027":[],"tt0028192":["Revealing mistakes: The sign at the marshal's office reads \"Marshall's Office\"."],"tt0185371":["Errors in geography: The film is set in L.A. At the end of the movie, the sun is shown rising over the ocean (some have argued that the time is uncertain and that it could just as easily be sunset).","Continuity: Price's name appears on the poster and the bankdrafts as Steven Price, however, in the closing credits, Geoffrey Rush [/name/nm0001691/] is credited as Stephen Price.","Continuity: Pritchett empties the remaining scotch from the bottle into his glass twice before Eddie knocks the glass out of his hand.","Revealing mistakes: When the camera tracks in on Schecter in the control room in the haunted house, there are two very conspicuously CG-added Blockbuster video boxes under some paper. They wobble as the camera moves closer to them.","Continuity: The scar on Evelyn's face keeps changing sizes and positions on her right cheek.","Continuity: The scars on Sara's forehead and cheek keep vanishing and reappearing on different sides of her face, and are all completely gone by the end of the film.","Continuity: In the final chase, Sara's jacket disappears between shots (shots where she loses the jacket were cut).","Revealing mistakes: Some of the warnings in the basement are in very bad German - it seems somebody just used a dictionary and translated the English lines word-for-word. For example, one sign has the phrase \"Steh zurück!\" which means something like \"Stay back!\". A correct translation would be \"Zurückbleiben\" or in this context \"Eintritt verboten\" (\"No admittance\").","Continuity: When Price takes them all to the casket to get the guns, one of the windows is not shuttered yet \"lockdown\" had already happened.","Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Melissa Margaret Marr first screams, she screams when she sees the ghost. When everyone looks over her tape, she screams when the ghost takes her into the house.","Continuity: Sara Wolfe's wandering through the basement is out of sequence. At one part she wanders into a darkened room filled with debris, but then in the close-up, there is a light through a door to her right as well as a clear path for her. In fact, the halls she wanders through keep changing from long shot to close-ups.","Boom mic visible: When Taye Diggs and Ali Larter walk into the Zoetrope room, the mic is visible at the top right of the screen, peeking out from behind the zoetrope tank.

You see him raise his hands in the air, and neither of them shows any evidence of the cuts he sustained while breaking the glass in an earlier scene.","Continuity: When Sara and Eddie are in the lobby en route to the attic (which is at the top of the tower, proven by the fact that when they escape out the window, that is where they end up), \"the house\" is right behind them. It is not plausible for them to be able to run all the way to the attic without being engulfed by the house.","Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): In the scene where Price, Baker, Sara, and Pritchett are first exploring the basement, Pritchett says that nothing has been done to the basement area of the house since 1931. However, throughout the movie we can clearly see halogen lights mounted on the walls throughout the rooms in the basement.","Revealing mistakes: Several times during the movie, a character cocks a gun and the click of a gun being cocked is heard, but each time, the gun the actor is holding is shown with the hammer in the decocked position.","Boom mic visible: (At 36:50) When Taye Diggs and Ali Larter walk into the Zoetrope room, the mic is visible at the top right of the screen, peeking out from behind the zoetrope tank.
