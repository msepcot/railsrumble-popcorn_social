Exploitation filmmakers hoped to capitalize on the taboo subjects of venereal disease, sex before marriage, lesbianism, etc. while skirting the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 which forbade a film from containing such content. Films like this would tour the United States for years - mostly being shown in rundown, skid row theaters. This film has been re-edited and re-titled (\"Human Wreckage\", \"They Must Be Told\", \"Trial Marriage\", \"About Trial Marriage\") many times to attract the same audience to film, to take advantage of a taboo subject which may have gotten press recently or to appease local censors who disapproved of the film's content.

The Code forbade the portrayal of immoral acts like drug use. (<i>The illegal drug traffic must not be portrayed in such a way as to stimulate curiosity concerning the use of, or traffic in, such drugs; nor shall scenes be approved which show the use of illegal drugs, or their effects, in detail.</i>) The film toured around the country for many years - often being re-edited and re-titled (\"Tell Your Children\", \"Dope Addict\", \"Doped Youth\", \"Love Madness\", \"The Burning Question\"). It was re-discovered in the early 1970s by NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and screened again as an example of the government's demonization of marijuana. NORML may have been confused about the film's sponsorship since one of the film's distributors, Dwain Esper, testified to the Arizona Supreme Court that \"Reefer Madness\" was not a trashy exploitation film but was actually sponsored by the U.S. Government - a convincing lie, but a lie nonetheless. That being said, the film is still quick enjoyable since it dramatizes the \"violent narcotic's ... soul destroying\" effects on unwary teens, and their hedonistic exploits enroute to the bottom.

Later, Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie.

Casting an ominous shadow over the townspeople who dare not look upon it, the unholy dwelling is home to one Count Orlok (Max Schreck) , an undead night creature with a taste for human blood. Into this picture steps Hutter, an unwary traveler who visits the Count. He carries with him the deed for a property Orlock wishes to buy in Hutter's home town of Wisborg. That night, in preparation for the long sea voyage ahead, the vampire hastily loads his coffin aboard ship and waits...

The films' often-skewed visions construct an American history filled with horror and hope, unreeling in familiar and unexpected ways. PANORAMA EPHEMERA focuses on familiar and mythical activities and images in America (1626-1978). Many creatures and substances that we hardly notice because we feel so used to them take center stage, including pigs, corn, water, telephones, fire, and rice. At first resembling a compilation, it soon reveals itself as a journey through the American landscape over time, and the story begins to emerge between the sequences. The film consists of 64 self-contained film sequences ranging from 5 seconds to 4 minutes in length arranged into a narrative. Unlike many films made using archival footage, it's primarily a combination of sequences rather than a collage of individual shots. PANORAMA EPHEMERA is populated by American children, animals, farmers, industrial workers, superheroes, pioneers heading West, crash test dummies, and many others.

Fortunately for Luci, her Mum's childhood friend is now a very successful upper-middle class doctor who has decided to take Luci home to his family (on a trial basis).

But he also had a brief Hollywood heyday during the mid 1940s, when he made some of his best films. Scarlet Street has been claimed by film noir. This attribution is understandable. The lighting is dark, with heavy use of shadows. The characters are all shady as well. Kitty is certainly a femme fatale, although hints are dropped that she is an inherently decent person who has become completely corrupted by Johnny. Being the most naive, Robinson is also the most sympathetic. But even he eventually turns to crime to fulfill his passions. But while Scarlet Street has elements of film noir, it is in reality a black comedy. While Robinson plays it straight throughout, Bennett and Duryea camp it up marvelously. Bennett laughs when Robinson claims to be a painter: \"And here I had you pegged as a cashier!\" She also has to suppress laughter when Robinson reveals that he is married, and shock when Duryea passes her off as the mysterious painter.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.32,"identifier":"ScarletStreet","subject":["Film-Noir","Drama","Black Comedy","Fritz Lang"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["Film_Noir","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]},{"title":"Last Woman On Earth","description":"You can find more information regarding this film on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054017/\" rel=\"nofollow\">its IMDb page</a>.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":3.5,"identifier":"last_woman_on_earth1960","subject":["Sci-Fi"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]},{"description":"US government propaganda film made during WWII touting the virtues of hemp.

A narrator told the story of the 10 crewmen as examples of simple average American boys doing a tough job. The men and plane were filmed during the bombing raid on the submarine plens in Wilhelmshafen, Germany, \"just one mission of just one plane and one crew in one squadron in one group of one wing of one Air Force out of fifteen United States Army Air Forces.\" It used handheld 16mm and 35mm cameras inside the plane to give the perspective of the crew. Wyler in fact combined footage from several missions to represent this last 25th mission of the plane, a mission that was actually a milk run with no casualties and no difficult landing. He also used film shot by the 8th AAF Combat Camera Unit. Wyler wanted to film a flak burst but never was able to get one: \"I could never get one explosion because how the hell do you know where one's going to explode? Once the cloud is there it's too late. All that flak so close to us, and I could never get the explosion.\" From October 1943 to March 1944, Wyler edited in the U.S. the 20,000 feet of film he shot in Europe, producing a 42-minute color film that was considered beautiful and dramatic.","title":"The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":5.0,"identifier":"TheMemphisBelleAStoryofaFlyingFortress","subject":["WWII","war","documentary","b17"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films","moviesandfilms"]},{"title":"The Child Molester (1964)","description":"Produced by the Highway Safety Foundation in 1964, this shocking film deals with a subject quite taboo for its time.

This film explores the origins in the 1940s and 50s of Islamic Fundamentalism in the Middle East, and Neoconservatism in America, parallels between these movements, and their effect on the world today. From the introduction to Part 1 (Baby It's Cold Outside): \"Both [the Islamists and Neoconservatives] were idealists who were born out of the failure of the liberal dream to build a better world. And both had a very similar explanation for what caused that failure. These two groups have changed the world, but not in the way that either intended. Together, they created today's nightmare vision of a secret organized evil that threatens the world, a fantasy that politicians then found restored their power and authority in a disillusioned age. And those with the darkest fears became the most powerful.\" The Power of Nightmares was first broadcast on BBC Two in three hour-long parts on consecutive Wednesday evenings in the autumn of 2004. The series was rebroadcast in late January 2005 on three consecutive nights, with the final part updated to reflect the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial is illegal. This DVD is of the updated version of January 2005, and is NTSC, no region; many PAL DVD players will play NTSC DVDs, but the reverse is not true, so NTSC it is.

The story is set in a remote New Mexico town where the workers live in a company town in company owned shacks without basic plumbing. Put at risk by cost cutting bosses, the miners strike for safe working conditions. As the strike progresses the issues at stake grow beyond that, driven by the workers' wives. At first the wives are patronized by the traditional patriarchical culture, however they assert themselves as equals and an integral part of the struggle, calling for improved sanitation and dignified treatment. Ultimately, when the bosses win a court order against the workers preventing them from demonstrating gender roles reverse with the wives taking over the picket line and preventing scab workers from being brought in while the husbands stay at home and take care of house and children. This film was selected for the National Film Registry in 1992 by the Library of Congress. It became public domain after its copyright was not renewed in 1982. \"Salt of the Earth\" was produced, written and directed by victims of the Hollywood blacklist. Unable to make films in Hollywood they looked for worthy social issues to put on screen independently. This film never would have been made in Hollywood at the time, so it is ironic that it was the anti-communist backlash that brought about the conditions for it to be made. In many ways it was a film ahead of its time, mainstream culture did not pick up on its civil rights and feminist themes for at least a decade.

The film's copyright was renewed in 1986 by Wade Williams 3 (RE0000279707). In 1981, Williams lodged a quitclaim from Kathy Wood (Edward D. Wood Jr.'s second wife [1956-his death] and heir. USCO doc. no. V1831P045) and separate quitclaims of interest from Norma McCarty (Edward D. Wood Jr.'s first wife - falsely listed on the filing as “Mrs. Edward D. Wood, Jr., successor of all rights to the Estate of Edward D. Wood, Jr.”, which she was not, as their marriage had been annulled) - and Reynolds Pictures, Inc. <b>This renewal was legally invalid for these reasons:</b> 1) The registration and renewals were lodged providing the incorrect title on screen, date-in-notice and publication date for the original publication. 2) In order for a successor in interest to renew a copyright they have to demonstrate that they own the copyright through a valid transfer of rights from the party owning the copyright at or immediately before the renewal window. None of the parties Mr. Williams sought quitclaims from were valid owners of copyright immediately prior to the renewal window. Valid copyright successors for this film “James Flocker Enterprises Inc.”, “Gold Key Video”, \"Vidtronics Inc.”, and “Medallion Pictures”, all companies who are successors in the chain of ownership post registration, are not present in Williams' quitclaims. Williams has, instead, provided the the USCO with a series of meaningless assignments from parties which no longer held any copyright interest in the work in order to demonstrate “ownership” of the intellectual property in the film. The screenplay was further registered as an unpublished work in 1989 (Pau001211635). This again is rendered legally invalid by the mere fact that large portions of the screenplay were previously published as part of the registered motion picture for which no valid copyright renewal exists.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.44,"identifier":"Plan_9_from_Outer_Space_1959","subject":["Sci-Fi","Horror"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"Bulldog Drummond's Revenge","description":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028670/ Most of the story-line revolves around a secret new explosive that a scientist has invented, which the villains would obviously love to get their hands on.

The League of Noble Peers are delighted, after more than a year, to release Part II of STEAL THIS FILM. In this film, we have tried to go beyond the current discussions around file-sharing to look at what kinds of social change are precipitated by massive changes in our capacity to communicate. We think the changes wrought by networked, peer distribution are historical on the scale of the printing press and here we try to explain why. For many of you these argument will be familiar. These are strange times, in which to many of us the battle already seems to have been won. And yet we have to accept that all the time harsh laws are being enacted, lawsuits levied against innocent people, arrests made - all intended to destroy or delay what is an inevitable change in how we look at creative work. We hope STEAL THIS FILM II can be useful in bringing new people into the legions of those prepared to think creatively about the future of distribution, production and creativity.

It should be noted that serials were nothing new at this point in time. Formative efforts such as THE PERILS OF PAULINE had already established the appeal of these generally inexpensive actioners, with their bizarre twists and inventive death traps. The emphasis was generally on a resourceful protagonist pitted against an equally inventive and determined fiend -- frequently an unsuspected heir or lawyer out to obtain an undeserved inheritance. LES VAMPIRES did this formula one better, making the menace a vast and largely unsuspected criminal empire which is devouring Paris from inside. With members taken from all classes, the dark society is able to plunder, blackmail and murder without dear of action from the authorities. This continues until their removal of a government investigator brings ambitious reporter Philippe Guerande (Edouard Mathe) into things. Sent to the country to search for details on the official's murder, Philippe plans to combine business and pleasure by meeting Dr. Lox, an old family friend who has a chateau in the area. Arriving at Lox's estate at the same time as an American heiress who means to purchase the property, the reporter is promptly framed for theft by the hooded agents of the gang, who are secreted in the ancient building. Locating the dead investigator's head, Philippe manages to turn suspicion on Lox. Murdering the heiress and making his escape across the rooftops, the \"doctor\" is revealed as the Grand Vampire the (evident) leader of the criminal society. Philippe falls into the Vampires' hands but is rescued by Oscar Cloud Mazamette (Marcel Levesque) -- a clerk and minor member of the gang whom he had helped earlier. Philippe and Mazamette combine to try to expose the society's operations and bring the gang to a deserved end. A series of adventures follow, with the Grand Vampire (Fernand Herrmann) and exotic dancer/criminal Irma Vep (Musidora) providing much of the opposition. In a surprise development, it is revealed that the Grand Vampire is not the gang's ultimate leader. When it is convenient, his superior eliminates him. He, in turn, commits suicide when he is imprisoned by the police. Satanas, the criminal mastermind behind the group's poisons and explosives steps in and assumes co-command with Irma Vep. This occurs too late, however, as Philippe is closing in on the gang's chief meeting place. After a series of close calls, the reporter and the reformed Mazamette succeed in destroying the Vampires' leadership and bringing the rank and file members to justice. Not enough emphasis can be placed on the serial's grim and stark look, which almost functions as a characters of its own. This is a Paris where the gang's activities have seemingly terrified the people to the degree that they refuse to venture out unless it is absolutely unavoidable. Production took place during WW I, when the streets were largely abandoned, and this strange desolation combines with the scurrying of the few characters to present a powerful emphasis that goes beyond the actual turns and twists of the plotline. The result is compelling, entertaining, and more than a bit weird in spots. Tinted scenes add to the welcome air of unreality.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.5,"identifier":"LesVampires1915DirectedByLouisFeuillade","subject":["dwid hellion","Les Vampires","Louis Feuillade","horror","silent film","edward gorey","paris cinema"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["silent_films","feature_films"]},{"title":"The General (complete & clearer)","description":"<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"http://ia311014.us.archive.org/3/items/The_General_Buster_Keaton/_General--front.jpg\" alt=\"_General--front.jpg\" /></p> <table width=\"90%\" cellpadding=\"8\" align=\"center\"><tr bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"><td> <font><b>A great Buster Keaton silent movie.

Mike was the first full-scale hydrogen explosive device to be tested, yet was only a scientific test of a thermofusion implosion device concept. Mike was not a deliverable weapon. The island where the device was detonated was vaporized. The hole Mike left was big enough to accommodate 14 Pentagon-size buildings and deep enough to hold 17 story building under water, in a crater one mile in diameter and approximately 175 feet deep. Mike's yield was an incredible 10.4 megatons, signaling the proof-tested expansion of the nuclear explosive technology concepts from nuclear fission to thermofusion. Thermofusion is the same process that occurs in the core of the Sun. This test, however, was not the first test of a liquid thermonuclear explosive. The first test ever conducted into the fusion principle occurred during Operation GREENHOUSE at Eniwetok in 1951, with the 225 kiloton George test. Another test of hydrogen in the center of a nuclear weapon before Mike was during the GREENHOUSE Item test at Eniwetok, proving a critical stockpiling yield efficiency concept, called \"boosting.\" The detonation of the Mike device was the climax of an intense debate over what would be the nation's correct response to the startling news in 1949 that the Soviet Union had detonated a nuclear weapon. Many wanted the U.S. to develop the means to produce and field a large number of fission bombs of varying yields which could be used for tactical purposes. Others believed that the country should institute a crash program like the Manhattan Project to develop a Super weapon based on the idea of forcing together or fusing light atoms with a fissile device to produce enormous amounts of energy. After a bitter fight among scientific, government and military officials, the President opted for a crash program to demonstrate the Super bomb, now called a hydrogen or thermonuclear weapon. Many designs were evaluated and rejected until the Mike proposal came along. This concept involved the cooling of hydrogen fuel to a liquid form, near absolute zero, and fusing the hydrogen nuclei into helium using a nuclear fission bomb as a trigger. The Mike device was a 22-foot-long, 5-foot-diameter cylinder housing canisters of liquid hydrogen fuel. These liquid fuel canisters were heavily encased with the nuclear fission explosive trigger. The Mike shot occurred on October 31, 1952, as scientists watched from 40 miles away as the mushroom cloud rose into the stratosphere. Mike was followed on November 15, 1952 by the King shot, the largest all-fission device ever tested by the United States. It was a uranium super oralloy Mark 18 prototype implosion core in a Mark 6D casing, with an advanced warhead that enabled it to produce 500 kilotons of equivalent TNT explosive energy. About the Mike phase narrator: Reed Hadley narrated and hosted this portion. Parallel to his public life as a radio, television, and movie star -- with the credit of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- Reed Hadley worked in a top secret military role as a presenter for Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) films. AFSWP produced films through the United States Air Force Lookout Mountain Laboratory located in Hollywood, California. These AFSWP films covered analysis and documentary archives in nuclear weapons testing, special weapons systems development, as well as Civil Defense films. A key role of the laboratory was to produce films for national defense projects archives, military training films, and documentation for top secret oversight and appropriations committees of United States Congress. About the King phase narrator: Carey Wilson narrated this portion. Wilson was a very influential producer and scriptwriter in Hollywood -- principally with MGM -- and led a double life role as a \"Q-Clearance\" presenter and contributing scriptwriter in top secret films produced by the Atomic Energy Commission and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Q-Clearance was a top secret classification within the Atomic Energy Commission, later renamed to the Department of Energy. Interviewed in this film was the firing team commander, Stanley W. Burriss. He was an engineer by profession. He later became among the greatest forces for creating the U.S. Fleet Ballistic Missile, and later, critical contibutions to generations of Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident weapons systems. He managed this unprecedented scientific, engineering, and command management undertaking, which had profound effects on the civilian space program. Burriss retired as president of Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, after 25 years with Lockheed, and died in the spring of 1979. Captain Jack S. Hartwick, appearing near the beginning of the film in the bridge, was the commander of the USS Estes, host to the Mike device firing control and Joint Task Force 132 operations command center. Major General Percy Clarkson was supreme commander of Joint Task Force 132. Some notes about filming techniques of 1950s color filming: 1950s color film was not capable of satisfactory sensitivity to light in darkness. A workaround was to film during the daylight, using a blue filter. The low sensitivity to blue light -- the most sensitive was yellow -- of the color film made for dark scenes that simulated nighttime or hours of darkness. Notice the bright reflections of ambient light and the tall shadows during the \"hours of darkness\" scenes. This was not the moon creating these shadows. The film's hours of darkness scenes appear very dark in digitized form, played on a personal computer. Burning the DVD file as a data import file (without reencoding in MPEG2!) will have a much brighter picture when played on a home TV or theater system. Comments concerning DOE/DoD film releases in VHS: Disappointment and irritation are the common reactions to the DOE release procedure of transferring their Digital Betacam format masters to VHS. This change in colorspace formats creates very pale, horizontal lines in the picture. The ritual procedure of releasing sanitized and unclassified DOE/DoD films through the Authorized Derivative Declassification (ADD) experts at Kirtland is to edit the transfer of 16 mm celluloid to Digital Betacam master tapes by selectively turning off the capture of audio, video, or both to preserve DOE/DoD secrets. VHS NTSC tape releases are then derived from Digital Betacam tapes.

He'd appear as a mummy, Count Dracula, a deranged hunchback, and his most famous role of Waldemar Daninsky, the doomed werewolf. After directing several successful \"El Hombre Lobo\" romps for Naschy, León Klimovsky was back on hand for this undead entry, known in Spain as LA REBELION DE LAS MUERTAS. Naschy takes on two roles; an East Indian guru named Krishna and his scarred brother Kantaka, who uses some kind of voodoo to bring back the dead and haunt a redheaded British woman (Romy, who looks great in a pink nightgown) after her father gets the hatchet in the head. Like Klimovsky's DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, some of this film was shot on location in London, the city where it takes place in. Anyone expecting George Romero-inspired antics should look elsewhere. Klimovsky's zombies are mainly female actresses in black cloaks and blue face make-up who stroll around and grin a lot (they look something like the vamps in Andy Milligan's ultra-cheap THE BODY BENEATH). One haunting scene in which they attack a morgue attendant is somewhat reminiscent of Klimovsky's own WEREWOLF'S SHADOW (as well as a scene in the first \"Blind Dead\" film), with the bizarre image of the pasty-faced gals mutilating his neck with the rim a soda can!","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":1.5,"identifier":"Vengence_of_the_Zombies","subject":["zombie"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers","description":"\"Man is waylaid by chance in old home town, meets a girl down on her luck and a turbulent couple with whom he shares a dark childhood secret.

Set in 1881, on the eve of British colonial rule, it is based on a true story: an Upper Egyptian clan had been robbing a cache of mummies near the village of Qurna, and selling the artifacts on the black market. After a conflict within the clan, one of its members went to the police, helping the Antiquities Service find the cache. The film casts this story in terms of the search for an authentic, lost Egyptian national identity (represented by the neglected and misunderstood artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization), but the conflict between city and countryside suggests questions that are not resolved in the film, making it an ambiguous, unsettling reflection on the price of identity. Unusual camera angles, striking colours and slow editing give the film a dreamlike quality, reinforced by Mario Nascimbene's eerie music. For those who know Arabic, the dialogue is entirely in classical Arabic, which adds to the sense of unreality.

Hercules is now married to his beloved princess wife, and friend Ulysses tags along. They are traveling and encounter two warring brothers, fighting over rights to the thrown. Hercules gets pulled into things, but not before they try killing him, then getting rid of him with an amnesia giving drug. We enjoyed this film. Color is in Eastman Color by Pathe. Sound quality is very good. Visual quality is mostly good, with some choppiness, especially in fast action sequences; as the original film print gotten was only 23 frames per second, and when changed from mpeg to XviD avi, frame rate was changed to 29.976 frames per second.

Pál commissioned the script by James O'Hanlon and Rip Van Ronkel. The film was directed by Irving Pichel, was shot in Technicolor and was distributed in the USA by Eagle-Lion Classics. Four American astronauts blast off from the New Mexico desert and fly to the Moon. They land after difficulties that cause more fuel to be used than anticipated. Consequently, the crew must race against time to lighten the ship for a successful return to Earth. The film features the premise that US private industry will finance and manufacture the first spacecraft to reach the moon, given the Soviet threat at the time, and then the US government will bring itself to buy or lease the technology. Visionary industrialists are shown cooperating to support the venture. Destination Moon was the first major science-fiction film dealing seriously with the prospect, problems and technology of space travel produced in the United States, and won the Academy Award for Visual Effects in the name of the effects director, (Lee Zavitz). The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Ernst Fegte, George Sawley)[1]. The eminent science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein contributed significantly to the script and served as a technical advisor. Heinlein also published, about the same time as the release of the film, \"Destination Moon.\" a novella of the same name that was based on the screenplay. The film was promoted through an unprecedented onslaught of publicity in the print media. Seven years before Sputnik, the movie clearly spells out a rationale for the space race: unnamed enemies (clearly understood at the time to be the Soviets) are sabotaging the American space program, and unless the West beats them to the moon, they will establish a strategic advantage to conquer the world. Destination Moon includes an animated segment of Woody Woodpecker illustrating the basics of space flight. The segment serves to educate not only certain characters in the story, but the audience as well. As a narrative device, this technique has been employed in subsequent films, such as Jurassic Park. The film shows the rocket being constructed in situ in the desert, and Lockheed aircraft plant in Southern California is shown with workers examining a model of the nuclear spacecraft. Transitional sequences show Lockheed Constellations being assembled. The fictional rocket uses nuclear thermal propulsion, a method that has not been employed in actual rocket launches to date. This movie was not the first such to hit the screens, however; Rocketship X-M stole its thunder. The sets and costumes were re-used in films subsequently, and even appear in the second episode of The Time Tunnel. Both Destination Moon and Rocketship X-M contain a polemical element, but with almost diametrically opposed messages: where Rocketship X-M contains a seriously intended anti-nuclear message, Destination Moon has a nuclear-powered spacecraft taking off in defiance of a court order, and depicts the court order as inspired by irrational fear. Once on the moon, the crew find evidence that the moon is a source of uranium. A relationship between the film and Heinlein's novel Rocket Ship Galileo exists. In the novel, the astronauts are high school boys led by an older scientist, the enemies are the Nazis rather than the Soviets, and the emphasis is on conflict with them. In the movie, sabotage is only vaguely hinted at, the concept of a space race is introduced, the voyage is a massive industrial undertaking, and the plot revolves around the dangers of the voyage. A common element in both stories is that the rocket takes off in defiance of a court order. The movie is in fact more similar to Heinlein's novella The Man Who Sold the Moon, which according to its copyright date was written by 1949, although it was not published until 1951, the year after Destination Moon premiered. The matte and scene paintings for 'Destination Moon were created by the famous astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell. Pál also employed Bonestell for work on When Worlds Collide from the novel by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer; The Conquest of Space, which in turn was based on the book by Willy Ley and Bonestell; and The War of the Worlds, notably the opening","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.5,"identifier":"destinationmoon","subject":["Sci-Fi / Horror","Third Eye Cinema","space","george pal"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"X Marks The Spot","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","identifier":"x_marks_the_spot_1942","subject":["Crime","Detective"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","HTML","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Shockwave Flash","Thumbnail","Unknown"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"description":"Also known as \"Marked Men\" You can find more information regarding this film on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032763\" rel=\"nofollow\">its IMDb page</a>.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","title":"Desert Escape","avg_rating":3.67,"identifier":"desert_escape","subject":["Mystery"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films","moviesandfilms"]},{"title":"Angel on My Shoulder","description":"The Devil arranges for a deceased gangster to return to Earth as a well-respected judge to make up for his previous life.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":5.0,"identifier":"angelOnMyShoulder","subject":["Crime, Comedy, Romance"],"format":["HTML","MPEG4","Metadata","Shockwave Flash","Unknown"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"Reign of Terror","description":"Also known as \"The Black Book\".

The film opens with an African American minister in church telling his flock why they should join the armed forces to fight the Nazis.

The quality of the original film is very good, however there are a few \"issues\" apparent in this copy, which was made from a video in the National Achives' collection: - the original work was made up of 5 seperate film reels, there are some noticable breaks in continuity when the reels switch - the framing of the film to video transfer was a bit off, so there is a border visible throughout - there is occassional video dropout, probably due either to the age of the video tape at the National Archives NAIL Control Number: NWDNM(m)-111-M-6022 ARC Identifier: 35956","avg_rating":4.0,"identifier":"negrosoldier","subject":["World War II","African Americans","war"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG1","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Love Affair","description":"Directed by Leo McCarey, this 1939 romantic classic is the first and best version of the old warhorse of a fateful shipboard romance between an aimless playboy and a nightclub singer, both engaged but appearing to be destined to reunite on the top floor of the Empire State Building.

The courageous financiers of this project were the author Upton Sinclair, his wife Mary Craig and a small group of their friends. They had great difficulties in keeping the production going; the economic crisis forced Sinclair to call a halt to it in early 1932. Shooting was stopped with most of the work completed; only one episode could not be filmed. At the same time Josef Stalin insisted on Eisenstein's return to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein left Mexico with Sinclair's promise in mind; that all the negatives would be send to him to enable the final editing of the film in Moscow. Sinclair tried several times in vain to transfer the film footage to Russia, but the Soviet Film Industry was instructed not to import the film. Eisenstein had been denounced both as a political renegade and as a Trotskyite, which was, in the eyes of Stalin, a serious offence. Preventing Eisenstein from finishing his Mexican film was Stalin's punishment. Consequently Eisenstein was left without film work for several years and started teaching at the State Film School. The Stalinist propaganda, which heaped all the blame on Upton Sinclair for the tragic end of ¡Que viva México!, prevailed. Two films utilizing Eisenstein's film footage were made with Upton Sinclair's permission: Thunder over Mexico made in 1933 by Sol Lesser and Time in the Sun, made by Mary Seton in 1939/40. Thanks to the foresight of Sinclair, who in the 1950s deposited the unedited materials of Eisenstein's film with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the subsequent work of Jay Leyda to make them accessible, all is not lost. We are sure that seventy years of archival care and investment in preserving the essence of this film will eventually result in an authentic reconstruction of this lost film. Many film-historians are convinced that ¡Que viva México! is one of Eisenstein's greatest films. ¡Que viva México! stood at the crossroads of Eisenstein’s artistic development and at a crucial point in the evolution of the art of the cinema. This work deserves more than any other to be taken out of the archives, to be appreciated by a new generation! It is a treasure waiting to be discovered.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.67,"identifier":"QuevivaMexico","subject":["Mosfilm, Eisenstien, Film, Classic"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["silent_films","feature_films"]},{"description":"You can find more information regarding this film on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">its IMDb page</a>.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","title":"Law Rides, The","avg_rating":4.0,"identifier":"the_law_rides","format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films","moviesandfilms"]},{"title":"Wrong Road","description":"Spoiled young lovers rob bank and hide the loot.

He was at one of the best moments of his career when this spoof about the detective movie genre went into production. \"My Favorite Brunette\" was directed by Elliott Nugent with a style that made it fun and light to watch. The screen play by Edmund Beloin and Jack Rose parodies those films that showed a charismatic private eye get into all kinds of dangerous situations. In this film, Ronnie Jackson, a photographer in San Francisco is suddenly, thrown into a web of intrigue when he steps into the office of his neighbor, the real P.I, Sam McCloud, who is fed up with the job and is leaving town. Enter the femme fatale, something that is a must in this type of film, Carlotta Montay. She will get Ronnie into all kinds of difficult situations and even the gas chamber as he tries his best to deal with all the bad people that are chasing Carlotta. Bob Hope was excellent in his take of Ronnie Jackson. Dorothy Lamour, in all her beauty, made the most of her Carlotta. Two cameos in the film were notorious because they are uncredited and unexpected: Alan Ladd, and Bing Crosby. Others in the film are Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Dingle, Frank Puglia, Reginald Denny, among the supporting cast. The film is still a lot of fun as it makes fun of other more dramatic movies thanks to the direction of Elliott Nugent.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"My_Favorite_Brunette_Xvid","subject":["Death Row","Murder","Bob Hope","Detective"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"The Over-the-Hill Gang Rides Again","description":"The old-time comrades-in-arms join forces to sober up an old buddy, a down-and-out drunk, and restore his reputation.

Visionary and messenger of the Immaculate Conception, she told us the very words of the Virgin Mary, spoken in the native Basque tongue of Southern France and Northern Spain. She spoke words teaching of the merits of prayer, penance, poverty and church. In the first and most widely recognized Marian apparition of modern times, a personal message was delivered also to BernadetteShe would not find happiness in this world, but only in the next. She was to die twentyone years later in 1879 after a prolonged and painful illness. She remained hidden in a convent about 300 miles from home, a refuge from the interrogations and the pilgrims that never ceased seeking her. At thirtyfive, her strongwilled manner gave way to her frail body, and she finally entered into her eternal happiness. While she took with her the knowledge of certain secrets the Virgin gave her, one secret remained hidden in our presence. The most spectacular of all the incorruptibles, Bernadette's miraculously preserved body remained buried in a damp grave for thirty years until the cause for beatification was taken up. To this day, the body of Bernadette is a profound source of inspiration and of mystery surrounding the ways of the Lord. The face of Bernadette is one of surreal beauty, and will remain for us always the face that gazed into the eyes of the Mother of God. الإخوة الأحباء أضع بين أيديكم اليوم فيلماً رائعاً بكل ما تحمله من معاني كلمة رائع أكتب كلامي هذا وأنا احمل دموعي على خدي بعد أن أجهشت بالبكاء بعد مشاهدة هذا الفيلم الرائع الذي أثر في نفسي كثيراً لم أكن أدري أننا يجب أن نعاني لدخول ملكوت السموات وأدركت الآن أن رئيس العالم يحاول أن ينسيني أنني بضيقات كثيرة ينبغي أن أمر لكي أرث ملكوت السموات أذهلني كَم الألم والمعاناة التي عانتها هذه القديسة وكم الاتهامات والتشكيك من جانب الناس التي يحرّكها رئيس هذا العالم وبالمقابل الحب والبذل والهدوء والعلاقة السرية بينها وبين الإله الخالق. كم أشتاق أن يكون لي نفس هذه العلاقة الرائعة مع إلهي ومخلصي ، ولكن خطاياي التي أكتمها في قلبي خطاياي المحبوبة لنفسي مثل محبة إبراهيم لاسحق ولكن إبراهيم ضحى باسحق ولكني أرفض أن أضحي باسحاقي ، ارفض أن اضحي بخطيئتي لأني أجد فيها لذة ولم أجد في الله لذة سريعة. عندما شاهدت الفيلم وقصة هذا السيدة أدركت قيمة الله أو بالحري طلبت من الله أن يعطيني أن أدرك قيمته وغلاوته وحلاوة عشرته التي جعلت هذه المرأة تحتمل الأمراض الجسدية والاتهامات والهزء والتعيير بل وبعد كل هذا ترى نفسها لا تستحق الملكوت بل وأنها لم تفعل شيئاً أخجلني اتضاعها وفضح كبرياء المستتر بحلل الاتضاع الزائف أضع بين أيديكم صورة حية لقديسة عاشت وسطنا واضطهدها أناس ليسوا من الشارع وليسوا كفاراً بل رجال من الكنيسة لتكون لنا مثالاً أن نركِّز في شخص المسيح ولا نتأثر بأي شخص لا يسلك كما سلك المسيح بل نصلي من أجله ونثق أن كل أمورنا في يد الله نفسه وهو يهتم بنا كما يهتم الانسان بنفسه وبجسده يارب ارجوك بارك كل مَن يحضر هذا الفيلم ببركة روحية وافتح أذهاننا لأن الوقت المتاح لنا في هذه الحياة قصير جداً وهيئة هذا العالم ستزول ستزول ستزول أرجوك يارب افتح اعيننا لنرى ونصدق ونؤمن أننا سنغادر هذا العالم ولا نؤجل التوبة وأن نفضح أنفسنا بالاعتراف بخطايانا بدلاً من ننفضح أمام الخليقة كلها ونندم حيث لا ينفع الندم ونسكب الدموع الآن قبل أن يأتي وقت لا نجدها أصلي من أجلي نفسي بالدموع ومن أجل كل شخص يقرأ هذا الموضوع لنصلي جميعاً من أجل بعض ومن أجل العالم كله أن يعطينا الرب أذان صاغية لهمساته وقيرعه على قلوبنا جميعاً صلوا جميعاً من أجلي فيلم القديسة برناديت هاتان الصورتان هما للقديسة برناديت التي توفيت قبل 122 سنة ودفنت في لورد بفرنسا. لم يكتشف الجثمان الا قبل 30 سنة بعد ان قرر مسؤولو الكنيسة هناك معاينة الجثمان. لا يزال جثمان هذه القديسة البارة ناضرا كما لو ان صاحبته لم تمت. وان حدث وزرت لورد يوما فانك سترى الجثمان في الكنيسة. الجثمان لم يتفسخ لانه في حياتها كانت مريم العذراء تظهر لها دائما معطية لها رسائل ونصائح الى بني البشر حول الطريقة الصحيحة للعيش على الارض. حدثت العديد من المعجزات في هذا المكان ولا تزال تحدث.

http://www.latinseminary.org/saints/bern.jpg ولدت برناديت في يوم الأحد الموافق السابع من يناير عام 1844 في لورد وهي مدينة صغيرة على جبال البيرينيه في فرنسا الجنوبية، من أبوين فقيرين: فرنسيس سوبيرو وزوجته لويزا كاستيرو. وسُجّلت باسم برناديت – ماري سوبيروس. وخلال السنوات اللاحقة لمولدها رزق والداها بست أطفال أيضاً، مات ثلاثةً منهم. أُصيبت برناديت وهي بعد طفلة بسعال أليم (الربو) ولم تتمتّع برناديت بصحّة جيّدة وكانت قريبةً جداً من والديها وأخواتها واخوتها. وكان أهلها يحاولون مساعدتها بشتى الطرق. كانت لطيفة المعشر، دائمة الابتسامة بالرغم من ألمها والكل يحبها. عملت راعية غنم وهناك في قلب الطبيعة كانت تُصعد أجمل الصلوات للرب وللعذراء. وعاشت في مطحنة لكن بسبب الظروف الصعبة التي واجهت العائلة في هذه المطحنة والتي أدّت الى انخفاض كميّة وجودة الطحين وبالتالي عدد الزبائن، أُجبرت عائلة سوبيروس على ترك المطحنة والانتقال للعيش في منزل أكثر تواضعاً. وقام فرانسوا كلّ يوم بالبحث عن عمل وكانت أجرته ضئيلة جداً ما أدى الى عدم اعتنائه الصحيح بعائلته. وبسبب ذلك اضطرّت لويس سوبيروس الى مساعدة زوجها فذهبت الى العمل في حين قامت الابنة الكبرى برناديت بالاعتناء بالأطفال. صورة عائلة برناديت http://www.bakhdida.net/munaiso/lord_files/image001.jpg صورة عديدة لبروفيل لبرناديت http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/2cf2b3f3a5.jpg ضعف ذاكرتها جعلها تتعذب كثيراً لتتلقن مبادئ التعليم الديني المسيحي على الرغم من أن الناس حاولوا اعطاء برناديت دروساً في الانجيل لكن كان من الصعب حدوث ذلك نظراً لعدم توفّر الوقت الكافي لها. تمتّعت هذه الفتاة بالإيمان العميق وصلاتها الدائمة البسيطة التي كانت بحوزتها باستمرار عادت برناديت إلى أهلها بعد أن أمضت سنين عديدة لدى مربيتها في مدينة برتريس وهناك في لورد تلقت التعليم المسيحي مع رفيقاتها وتناولت سرّ الشركة (التناول). يا له من شعور رائع الرب الإله دخل فعلياً إلى قلبها!. يوم الثلاثاء، في الحادي عشر من شهر شباط 1858 ذهبت برناديت برفقة أختها وصديقتها لجمع الحطب قرب مغارة وهناك كانت المفاجأة الكبرى حيث ظهرت لها السيدة العذراء بينما كانت تستعد لعبور نهر صغير وراء رفيقاتها، أولاً بشكل ريح ثم بشكل امرأة جميلة تسحر القلوب بجمالها الفتّان. صلّت برناديت مسبحتها وهي مذهولة بجمال المرأة وعند آخر إشارة صليب اختفت المرأة، علمت أم برناديت بالأمر وحاولت إقناع ابنتها أنها لم تكن سوى تخيلات وطلبت منها عدم الذهاب الى المغارة ولكن برناديت كانت تصّر أنها لم تكذب وعادت إلى المغارة لأن المرأة طلبت منها العودة بعد خمسة عشرة يوماً. صورة للمغارة http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/a273681d2c.jpg وهكذا توالت ظهورات المرأة الجميلة لبرناديت وكان الناس يتقاطرون إليها من كل صوب منهم بدافع الفضول ومنهم للصلاة. كانت سذاجة برناديت وصدقها وحرارة صلاتها تؤثر كثيراً في من هم حولها وقد وعدتها العذراء بالراحة والسلام في الحياة الأبدية مع يسوع فقط ولم تعدها بالراحة هنا على الأرض. كان الناس يتزايدون حول المغارة يوماً بعد يوم مما خلق قلقاً واضطراباً لدى رجال الشرطة فبدءوا يستجوبون برناديت ويحاولون أن يشوهوا كلامها ولكن الناس كانوا يصدقون كلامها فدافعوا عنها بشدة. اضطهدها رجال السلطة كثيراً وعانت منهم كثيراً لدرجة أن بعضهم حاول تلفيق تهمة الجنون لها وإيداعها المصحة النفسية وكان هذا بدافع من الشيطان الذي يحاول أن يعطل عمل الله وسعيه لتبكيت الناس للتوبة. كانت العذراء وفي ظهوراتها لبرناديت تطلب منها دعوة الخطاة إلى التوبة والصلاة من أجلهم. وفي إحدى الظهورات وبينما كانت برناديت تصلي بحرارة مرت يدها فوق لهيب شمعة مضاءة وبقيت كذلك ربع ساعة ولم تحترق كما أفاد بذلك شاهد عيان. حفرت برناديت في الأرض بجانب المغارة بناءً لطلب السيدة وللحال خرج ماء حيث شربت منه برناديت وقد أصبح هذا النبع الصغير نبع نِعَم شفى الكثير من المرضى بالنفس والجسد ولم يزل حتى يومنا هذا. ومن الذين شفوا: طفل ابن سنتين كانت أمه قد قطعت الأمل بشفائه فلجأت إلى معونة العذراء، ورجل كان يعاني من عمى في عينيه وفتاة عمياء أُعيد لها البصر. صورة نبع المياه http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/e8a87fdfdc.jpg وكانت الجموع تحتشد في ذلك المكان مصلّية من أعماق قلوبها الألوف من السلام الملائكي. بناءً لطلب كاهن الرعية الذي كان قد قال لبرناديت أن تسأل عن اسمها أجابت: \"أنا الحبل بلا دنس\". أي أنها النقية الطاهرة التي حضّرها الآب لتكون يوماً أماً لإبنه وقد طلبت العذراء بناء كنيسة في ذلك المكان وبالفعل بُنيت الكنيسة حيث يحتفل آلاف المؤمنين بالصلاة والافخارستيا في كل مرة. لقد تمّ فحص مياه النبع مرات عديدة ولكن لم يستطع أحد اكتشاف سر قوتها، إنها قدرة العذراء الكلية القداسة. قدمت برناديت ذاتها بكليتها إلى الله ودخلت دير راهبات المحبة حيث عملت في خدمة المرضى والأطفال وكانت راهبة متفانية في بذل ذاتها بمحبة وتقوى. وفي آخر حياتها بقيت مريضة لمدة خمس سنوات، تناجي حبيبها يسوع وأمها العذراء بحب وفرح وسلام داخلي إلى أن انتقلت إلى لقائهما الأبدي في السادس عشر من نيسان سنة 1879 وقد منحها الله نعمة كبيرة بأن قد بقي جسدها سالماً طرياً وكأنها ماتت منذ يوم وهو معروض في نعش زجاجي داخل كنيسة دير راهبات المحبة. وفي كانون الأول 1933 أُعلِن قداستها وأصبحت مدينة لورد مكاناً مقدساً يقصده المؤمنون من كافة العالم لينالوا النعم ويصلّوا للعذراء البريئة من الدنس ويطلبون شفاعة برناديت، تلك الفتاة التي كانت مطيعة لكلمة الرب في حياتها وقد انتقتها العذراء لتنقل إلينا رسالتها وتدعونا من خلالها للتوبة والقداسة. الله يختار الضعفاء والمتواضعين ليُظهر قدرته وحبّه وعظمته. لنكن متواضعين كبرناديت ونتشبّه بالقديسين في اتضاعهم، حتى نصل إلى القداسة صورة للمغارة وتمثال العذراء http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/e6d0993500.jpg تواريخ الظهورات التي حدثت في لورد لبرناديت سوبيروس الظهور الأول في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الحادي عشر من فبراير عام 1858 خرجت برناديت سوبيروس البالغة من العمر 14 سنة، وأختها تيونيت 12 سنة، وصديقتهم الصغيرة جانّيه أبادي 13 سنة لجمع الأخشاب. فمشوا الى مازابييل ورأوا هناك كهفاً أمامه جدول مياه. وبينما كانت تهمّ برناديت سوبيروس بخلع حذائها وجواربها لتعبر الجدول، سمعت صوت عصفة ريح. وتكرّر هذا الصوت مرة أخرى، عندها نظرت الى الكهف فرأت سيدة جميلة مكتسية بفستان أبيض وحزام أزرق وزهرتين على قدميها. وأشارت السيدة الى برناديت بإصبعها للاقتراب منها. تجمّدت برناديت في مكانها وحاولت بشكل تلقائي سحب المسبحة والركوع ورسم إشارة الصليب على وجهها. إلا أنّها لم تستطع القيام بذلك حتّى قامت السيدة التي تحمل مسبحة ذات صليب كبير ومُشع بعمل إشارة صليب. وفي أثناء صلاتها رأت برناديت السيدة وهي تُفلت خرزات المسبحة الواحدة تلو الأخرى لكن دون أن تحرّك شفتيها. دامت هذه الرؤية نحو 15 دقيقة. ولم تلحظ الفتيات الأخريات أي شيء من هذه الرؤية لكن برناديت أخبرتهم بما حدث كما أطلعت والدتها على ذلك. الظهور الثاني في لورد – يوم الأحد الموافق الرابع عشر من فبراير عام 1858 يوافق هذا اليوم عيد كنسي ، وقد انتاب برناديت شعورٌ يحتّم عليها الذهاب الى الكهف بالرغم من معارضة والدتها لهذا الأمر. وبعد محاولات عديدة لإقناع أمّها، نجحت برناديت وهمّت بالذهاب إليه مع صديقتيها وأخذت معها زجاجة مليئة بالماء المقدّس لرشّه على العذراء إذا رأتها مرة أخرى هناك. وعند وصولهنّ الى الموقع ركعن وصلّين المسبحة. رأت برناديت السيدة العذراء وبيدها السبحة فقامت برشّ الماء المقدّس باتّجاهها وقالت لها: \"إن جئت من عند الله، فابقي. وإن لم تكوني من عنده فاذهبي بعيداً\". وحينما كانت ترش برناديت الماء المقدس أكثر كانت السيدة العذراء تبتسم أكثر فأكثر. وحينما فرغت الزجاجة من الماء واصلت برناديت الصلاة واختفت السيدة العذراء. الظهور الثالث في لورد- يوم الثلاثاء الموافق الثامن عشر من فبراير عام 1858 في الصباح الباكر ركعت برناديت في الكهف. وذهب معها بعضٌ من البالغين من القرية وأعطوها قلماً وورقة. دخلت برناديت الى الكهف وطلبت من السيدة التالي: \"اكتبي لي اسمك على هذه الورقة لو سمحتي\". وكان ذلك ما طلبه منها الناس. وقد سمعت برناديت الإجابة: \"ذلك ليس ضروريّاً\". ثم قالت لها السيدة: \"هل ستكونين صالحة بما فيه الكفاية لتأتي الى الكهف على مدى خمسة عشر يوماً؟\". فأجابت برناديت: \"نعم، أعدك\". ووعدتها العذراء بالتالي: ثم قالت لها السيدة: \"أرغب برؤية الكثير من الناس هنا\". وكانت هذه المرة الأولى التي تسمع بها برناديت وبوضوح صوت العذراء المقدّسة العذب. وقد دام هذا الظهور أقل من نصف ساعة. الظهور الرابع في لورد – يوم الجمعة الموافق التاسع عشر من فبراير عام 1858 لم تعد برناديت سوبيروس خائفةً من الذهاب الى كهف مازابييل وشعرت بانجذاب روحيّ يحثّها على التوجّه إليه. كما ذهب معها ست أو سبع نساء من بينهنّ خالة برناديت. وبعد تلاوتهنّ للسلام المريميّ لثلاثة مرّات ظهرت العذراء ودام ذلك لنصف ساعة. وفي ذلك اليوم أخذت برناديت معها شمعة مباركة وهو شيء اعتادت القيام به كل يوم على مدى الأربعة عشر يوماً التي ظهرت فيهم العذراء والذي وافق الأخير فيه الثالث من مارس من عام 1858. الظهور الخامس في لورد – يوم السبت الموافق العشرين من فبراير عام 1858 اجتمع مع برناديت في هذا اليوم ما يقارب الثلاثين شخصاً. تكرّرت الرؤية وعند انتهائها قالت برناديت بنفسها المطمئنّة القليل عن الرؤية. قالت وبوضوح أنها ولمرّة أخرى شاهدت \"السيدة الجميلة\"، التي ابتسمت لها وهي داخل الكهف. الظهور السادس في لورد- يوم الأحد الموافق الواحد والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 حضر في هذا اليوم ما يقارب المئة شخص الى الكهف مع برناديت وقد أدركوا تماماً مدى التأني في حركات برناديت. ظهرت العذراء لتنظر الى الجمع بعينيها المتلألئتين وقالت: \"صلّوا الى الخطاة\". وكان على برناديت تحمّل المقابلة الطويلة التي حدثت بعد ظهر ذلك اليوم مع مفوّض الشرطة جاكومي. وبقيت مع ذلك هادئة وجعلها أباها تعده بأن لا تذهب الى ذلك الكهف مرة أخرى. الظهور السابع في لورد – يوم الثلاثاء الموافق الثالث والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 قال الأب بوميان أن لا حقّ لأي أحد أن يمنعها من الذهاب الى الكهف. وفي ذلك اليوم كان هناك ما يقارب المئة شخص على الأقل من بينهم الدكتور دوزوس والكثير من الشخصيّات المهمّة في المدينة الصغيرة. وقد علّمت السيدة المقدّسة برناديت صلاة قصيرة ومميّزة والتي احتفظت بها لنفسها وقامت بصلاتها كل يوم الى أخر حياتها. كما وأملت عليها العذراء بعض التعليمات مفادها: \"اذهبي الى القساوسة وقولي لهم أنني أريد أن تُبنى كنيسة هنا\". الظهور الثامن في لورد – يوم الأربعاء الموافق الرابع والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 حضر الى الكهف نحو مئتين أو ثلاثمئة شخص ورأوا وجه برناديت والحزن بادٍ عليه وقد زحفت بركبتيها على الأرض وتوقّفت عدّة مرات لتتمتم؛ الكفّارة...الكفّارة... الكفّارة.... وقد قالت بعد ذلك، أنّ السيدة طلبت منها القيام بذلك كتكفير عن الخطأة. يا قديسة مريم.. صلّي لأجلنا نحن الخطأة الظهور التاسع في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الخامس والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 امتلأ الكهف ولمرّة أخرى بالناس. وقد بدى مظهر برناديت في هذا الظهور غريباً نظراً لما قالته لها العذراء: \"ابنتي، أريد أن أخبرك بسرّ أخير يخصّك، لا يجب أن تبوحي به لأحد. والآن اذهبي اشربي واغتسلي من النبع وكلي العشب النابت بجانبه. وأشارت العذراء مريم الى الكهف. ورأت برناديت ماءً قذرة موحلة لم تستطع الشرب منها. حاولت لثلاثة مرات أن تحفر بعمق أكثر فأكثر. وفي المحاولة الرابعة استطاعت أن تشرب من الماء وغسلت نفسها ثم أكلت من العشب. قال بعض الحاضرين أنها مجنونة لكن بعد أن حفرت برناديت في ذلك المكان انبثقت مياه غزيرة. وأصبح يسع ذلك النبع لمئة ألف لتر من الماء يومياً. وأطلق عليه الكثير من الناس \"ماء المعجزة\". وفي ذلك اليوم خضعت برناديت للاستجواب من قبل القائد الملكي ام. دوتور. لكن لم يحصد المحقّقون أي معلومات من هذا الاستجواب. صورة نبع المياه http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/743b205ebe.jpg الظهور العاشر في لورد – يوم السبت الموافق السابع والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 حضرالظهور العاشر ما يقارب 800 شخص. وقامت برناديت لمرة أخرى بشرب مياه النبع المتدفّقة وأكلت من العشب القريب منه. الظهور الحادي عشر في لورد – يوم الأحد الموافق الثامن والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 تبع ما يقارب الألف ومئة وخمسون شخصاً برناديت الى الكهف. وحضر رئيس ضباط العسكر مع سكرتيرته من تارب. تأثّرت برناديت بذلك وقالت أن الرؤية قد دامت لمدة أطول. وبعد الظهر تم استجوابها مرة أخرى من قبل الضابط الملكي ورئيس الشرطة. كما وحضر مدير المدرسة العليا المحليّة لطرح الأسئلة عليها بشكل انفراديّ. وقد اعتقد أنها كانت تعاني من الجُمدّة قبل أن يطرح عليها الأسئلة وبعدها أصبح متيقّناً أنّ الظهورات قد حدثت لها فعلاً. الظهور الثاني عشر في لورد – يوم الاثنين الموافق الأول من مارس عام 1858 تبعاً لإحصاءات الشرطة حضر في ذلك اليوم ما يقارب الألف وخمسمائة شخص. قامت برناديت مرة أخري بشرب الماء والاغتسال من النبع. وكان اليوم الأول الذي يحضر فيه القسّيس آبي ديزيرات الذي رسم كاهناً حديثاً والآتي من بلدة أوميكس الصغيرة القريبة من مازابييل. راقب هذا الكاهن برناديت بدقّة وعن قرب ثم قال بعد ذلك:\"ما هذا السلام التي تتحلّى به هذه الفتاة، ما هذه السكينة! وما هذه القداسة الرائعة! إن ذلك مستحيل بالنسبة الى طفلة لتقوم بذلك كلّه؛ إنها نقيّة وطاهرة، وجميلة أيضاً. لقد شعرت وكأنّني واقفٌ على عتبة السماء\". الظهور الثالث عشر في لورد – يوم الثلاثاء الموافق الثاني من مارس عام 1858 حضر في هذا اليوم ألفٌ وستمائة وخمسون مشاهداً. وسمعت برناديت العذراء تقول: \"اذهبي واطلبي من القسّيسين بناء كنيسة. أريد من الناس أن يأتوا الى هنا \". وعندما رأت برناديت الأب بيرامال كانت معاملته فظّة جداً ونسيت أمر الكنيسة تماماً. وعند عودتها الى القسّيس في المساء لتقول له ولثلاثة أخرين بقيّة الرسالة كانت ترتجف. وطلب منها قسّيس الأبرشية أن تسأل السيدة أولاً عن اسمها. الظهور الرابع عشر في لورد – يوم الأربعاء الموافق الثالث من مارس عام 1858 في صباح ذاك اليوم حضر الى الكهف ما يقارب الثلاثة آلاف الى الأربعة آلاف شخص، لكن لم يحدث أي شيء. عادت برناديت الى المكان بعد الظهر وبوجود مئة شخص رأت العذراء. وكما طلب منها قسّيس الأبرشيّة قامت بسؤال السيدة عن اسمها. ابتسمت السيدة دون أن تتفوّه بأي كلمة. فعادت برناديت لرؤية قسّيس الأبرشيّة، والذي بدوره قال لها بأنها ضعيفة وطلب منها مرة أخرى أن تسأل السيدة عن اسمها. الظهور الخامس عشر في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الرابع من مارس عام 1858 يوافق هذا اليوم يوم التسوّق في لورد كما أنه اليوم الأخير في الأيّام الخمسة عشر المذكورة في الظهور الثالث. توجّه ما يقارب العشرون ألف شخص نحو الكهف. وقد ساندت الشرطة قوّات أخرى من القرى المجاورة للمحافظة على الأمن. وظلّت برناديت سوبيروس ثلاثة أرباع الساعة داخل الكهف وحين خروجها توجّهت لرؤية قسّيس الأبرشيّة وقالت له أن السيدة ابتسمت ما أن سألتها عن اسمها، لكنها ما زالت تريد أن تُبنى كنيسة هنا. لكن بيرامال كرّر ما طلبه سابقاً وحتّم على برناديت سؤال السيدة عن اسمها. تبع ذلك توقّف في الظهورات، دام عشرين يوماً. وخلال ذلك لم تذهب برناديت الى الكهف ولم تشعر بشيء يقودها الى الذهاب الى هناك. وكانت هذه الفترة وقفة محبّبة لها من أجل استعادة الطمأنينة داخلها. كما وعادت الى المدرسة وهيّأت نفسها للمناولة الأولى. الظهور السادس عشر في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الخامس والعشرين من مارس عام 1858 يوافق هذا اليوم عيد البشارة. لم تستطع برناديت الذهاب الى الكهف لثلاثة أسابيع. وقد انتابها في ليل الرابع والعشرين والخامس والعشرين من شهر مارس شعور قويّ يحتم عليها الذهاب الى كهف مازابييل. وفي الساعة الخامسة صباحاً، حضر عدّة أشخاص من بينهم رئيس الشرطة الى الكهف. وما أن وصلت برناديت رأت السيّدة. وسألتها عن اسمها مكرّرةً هذا السؤال ثلاث مرّات. ابتسمت لها السيدة ثم تملّكت برناديت الشجاعة لسؤالها عن اسمها للمرة الرابعة! بعد ذلك كان هناك أيضاً توقّف في الظهورات الظهور السابع عشر في لورد – يوم الأربعاء الموافق السابع من أبريل عام 1858 ذهبت برناديت سوبيروس للاعتراف فتوقّع الناس منها الذهاب الى الكهف. وقامت بذلك كعادتها حاملةً معها شمعة مضاءة في يدها اليسرى، وبيدها اليمنى قامت بحماية الشعلة من الرياح. وأثناء انجذابها الروحيّ الذي دام خمس عشرة دقيقة. اتّجه اللهب نحو أصابعها لم يلحظ الدكتور دوزوس أي حرق على يدها وآمن بأن برناديت رأت حقاً العذراء. تبع ذلك أطول توقّف حدث بين الظهورات. الظهور الثامن عشر في لورد – يوم الجمعة الموافق السادس عشر من يوليو عام 1858 في يوم عيد تجلّي العذراء الكرمليّ، شعرت برناديت بحافز يحثّها على الذهاب الى الكهف. فذهبت في الثامنة مساءً الى هناك. حيث قامت السلطات في الظهور السابق بإغلاق الكهف اتباعاً للمرسوم الصادر في العاشر من يونيو عام 1585 والذي ينصّ على إغلاق المكان. ركعت برناديت على الضفة الأخرى من نهر غايف مع خالتها لوسيل. وبفترة قصيرة انجذبت روحيّاً بعمق كما حدث لها من شهور قليلة سابقة. وحينما سُئِلَت بعدها عن الذي قالته لها العذراء، أجابت: \"لا شيء\"، لكنّها قالت أنها لم تشاهد العذراء بهذا القدر من الجمال من قبل كالذي شاهدته في هذه المرة. وبعد هذا الظهور، عادت برناديت الى حياتها الطبيعيّة المؤمنة المتمثّلة بالإخلاص الكامل الى الرب لبقية حياتها. وقع الظهور الأول لهذه الظهورات الثمانية عشر للسيدة العذراء في لورد في الحادي عشر من فبراير من عام 1858. وخلال هذه الظهورات وبعدها أصبحت برناديت محطّ إعجاب الكثيرين كشخص مهم كما وابتعد أيضاً الناس عنها! ووجد أهلها صعوبةً في ذلك فكيف لهؤلاء الناس الفقراء الدفاع عن أنفسهم أمام ضغوطات العامّة المهدّدة لهم! لكن برناديت ومع ذلك بقيت محافظةً على طبيعتها المتّسمة بالبساطة والأمانة والمكرّسة لله. بقيت هادئة ومتقبّلة للاستهزاء الظاهر على وجوه المحقّقين الآتين من الكنيسة والسلطات، مقدّمةً مقاومة واضحة في وجه محاولاتهم وإصرارهم الفظ على تكرار ما حدث أثناء الظهورات. زاد ذلك كلّه من رغبة برناديت بأن تصبح راهبة فقرّرت الدخول الى دير نيفيرس. ونظراً لضعف صحّتها التي لا تخوّلها الى اتّباع القوانين الصارمة، أحبّت برناديت الاعتناء بالمرضى كما أنها قالت: \"لا أحد حاول إجباري على الذهاب الى الدير\". برناديت سوبيروس في نيفيرس في يوليو عام 1866، قامت برناديت بالالتحاق بدير أخوات محبة نيفيرس في سان غيلدارد، وهو مقرّ الأبرشيّة، آملةً في إشباع رغبتها المتمثّلة في تكريس حياتها الى الله. وقبل أن تترك لورد وعائلتها الحبيبة ذهبت برناديت الى الكهف في الرابع عشر من يوليو عام 1866. أخبرت الأخت ماري- برناديت في بداية حياتها الرهبانية جميع الراهبات بقصة الظهورات بكاملها والتي لم يُسمح لها بعد ذلك بذكر شيء عنها. أعطت بعض الراهبات الأرفع مقاماً برناديت أعمالاً وضيعة وعانت كثيراً من الإذلالات إلا أنها قبلت ذلك كلّه بصدر رحب. وقد أُعطيت مهام غرفة مشفى الدير، حيث أصبحت ممرضة ممتازة لكنها كانت تعاني من الربو كما أصيبت بالسل وفقدت الكالسيوم من عظامها وامتلأ جسمها بالجروح، واجتمعت معاناة المرض مع المعانات العقليّة لتعيش بذلك كل يوم. وما ذلك إلا تحقيق لطلبت السيدة العذراء السابق في لورد: \"صلّي للخطأة وكفّري عن الخطايا\". \"أعد أن أجعلكِ سعيدة، ليس في هذا العالم، بل في العالم الآخر\" توفيت برناديت يوم الأربعاء الموافق 16 أبريل عام 1879 عن عمر يناهز الخامسة والثلاثين. وقد زادت قوّتها الإيمانية وهي على فراش الموت وبعد عملية طويلة مضنية وبأمر من الكنيسة أٌعلنت الأخت ماري برناديت قديسة في الثامن من ديسمبر عام 1933. وقد بقي جسدها سليماً وحفظ في ضريح زجاجيّ في كنيسة الدير في نيفيرس. ملاحظتي الشخصية عن لورد وعلاقتها القوية مع الأخت ماري-برناديت: لم تكن برناديت تعرف معنى بعض العبارات التي قالتها السيدة العذراء . فقد كانت مجرّد فتاة صغيرة أمينة وصادقة. ومن الرائع أن تختارها السيدة العذراء. ومع أن الظهورات لم تجلب لها سوى المعاناة! إلا أن العالم في لورد قد بورك من جراء ذلك. كما يتدفّق أكثر من خمسة ملايين شخص كل سنة وهو شيء ليس بغريب. فعندما أقفل محافظ البلدية الكهف طلب منه مطران تاربي إعادة فتحه وقال: \"فقط الامبراطور يستطيع إعادة فتح الكهف. دعنا نرى من هو الأقوى، السيدة العذراء أم الإمبراطور؟\". وقد قام الامبراطور نابوليون الثالث بإعادة فتح الكهف، بطلب مكرّر وملح من الامبراطورة أوجين. صورة كاتدرائية لورد

Set in 1612 and actually based on real events. If this Musical Drama is not put on the internet achieve it will be lost for all time. In the shadow of Pendlehill A music Drama The Pendle witch trials of 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history, and some of the best recorded of the 17th century. The twelve accused lived in the area around Pendle Hill in Lancashire, and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft. All but two were tried at Lancaster Assizes 17â19 August 1612 along with the Samlesbury witches and others, in what became known as the Lancashire witch trials. One was tried at York Assizes on 27 July 1612, and another died in prison. Of the eleven individuals who went to trial â nine women and two men â ten were found guilty and executed by hanging and one was found not guilty. The Lancashire witch trials were unusual for England at that time in two respects: the official publication of the trial proceedings by the clerk to the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, and in the number of witches hanged together: ten at Lancaster and one at York. It has been estimated that in all of the English witch trials between the early-15th and early-18th centuries, fewer than 500 witches were executed, so this one series of trials over three days in the summer of 1612 accounts for more than 2% of that total. Six of the Pendle witches came from one of two families, each headed by a female in her eighties at the time of the trials: Elizabeth Southerns (aka Demdike), her daughter Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (aka Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Gray, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, trying to make a living from healing, begging and extortion.

It was originally presented in America by World Entertainment Corp. and Harris Associates, Inc. who re-named the film Gammera the Invincible. All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible's American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman. The film opens with Gamera's awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars. The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.33,"identifier":"gammera","subject":["Gammera","Third Eye Cinema","1960's","Sci-Fi/Horror"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"Jack and the Beanstalk","description":"Abbot and Costello musical, based on the fairytale You can read more about this movie on it's <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0044762/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDB page</a>","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.0,"identifier":"PublicDomainJackandtheBeanstalk","subject":["abbott & costello, musical, movies, fairy tales, public domain,films,classic"],"collection":["Comedy_Films","feature_films","moviesandfilms"],"format":["Video","512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"]},{"title":"His Majesty The Scarecrow of Oz","description":"Classic entry into L Frank Baum's silent Wizard of Oz Series.

It was created by an entirely unpaid group of amateur film-makers, with most of the film shot in the producer's house using bluescreen techniques. The film was then given away on the internet under a Creative Commons licence, with over 8 million people downloading it so far through official torrents and many more passing it on to their friends. The original translation was in simple American English in order to reach a wide global audience. However, I've done a slightly more detailed UK English translation as I think this better fits the feel of the original Finnish script. I think UK English also fits the comedy sci-fi genre better, as seen in Red Dwarf, Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and Doctor Who. Some of the jokes may seem a bit baffling to non-British people, but hopefully most of it can be appreciated by all English-speakers. This is my own totally unofficial translation, I have no connection to the makers of the film but I am a huge fan, and the film's official site encourages viewers to create their own subtitles. My translation was written in 2009, the original film was made in 2005. NOTE: The .avi download labelled \"DivX\" is actually an Xvid file, but it should also work on DivX players too. This is the highest quality version of this video.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/fi/","avg_rating":4.8,"identifier":"StarWreckInThePirkinning-UnofficialUkEnglishEdition","subject":["sci-fi","science fiction","spoof","parody","comedy","amateur film","independent film","low-budget film","indie film","cult","Finnish","Finland"],"format":["Metadata"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"STEAL THIS FILM","description":"In 2006, a group of friends decided to make a film about filesharing that we would recognise. There have been a few documentaries by 'old media' crews who don't understand the net and see peer-to-peer organisation as a threat to their livelihoods. They have no reason to represent the filesharing movement positively, and no capacity to represent it lucidly. We wanted to make a film that would explore this huge popular movement in a way that excited us, engaged us, and most importantly, focussed on what we know to be the positive and optimistic vision many filesharers and artists (they are often one) have for the future of creativity. Hopefully you'll enjoy the first part of STEAL THIS FILM ('Stockholm, Summer 2006'). It achieves some, but by no means all, of our goals. To continue we need your help. This film is free for you to share, watch on your DVD player or on your iPod, or show in cinemas. But if you like the work we've done and want us to carry on, use our donate link to send us a couple of dollars or euros. We will start making the second part straight away, and release it on www.stealthisfilm.com and on major BitTorrent trackers, when it's done. Each part, we estimate, will take about 2 months to complete. The plan for the second part is on this wiki. Feel free to add suggestions.

The story is partly based on two Conan Doyle short stories: \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Empty House\".

The film was released in July 1931 under the title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\". It was very successful, running for over a month on Broadway, which was unprecidented for a British produced programmer. Reviews hailed the film for \"bringing the real Sherlock Holmes to the screen.\" This prompted 4 more movies in the series The Missing Rembrandt (still considered lost), <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Sign_OF_Four\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sign of Four</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Triumph_of_Sherlock_Holmes\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Murder_At_The_Baskervilles\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles</a>.

Technical info: This DVD was sourced from high-quality 25fps PAL torrents that were recorded off-air in the UK. It was conformed to the NTSC \"film\" frame-rate (23.98fps) but your player will insert the necessary frames to display it on a traditional NTSC TV (29.97fps). The decision to use an NTSC format was based on 2 factors: 1) This series was broadcast in the UK. Viewers in the U.S.A. will probably never see this on TV or via commercial DVD, due to the expense of licensing the archive footage. So by using an NTSC format, I hope that the work can more easily reach a North American audience. 2) NTSC discs can be played by almost all PAL players, but many NTSC players cannot play PAL discs (regardless of region-coding).","avg_rating":4.0,"identifier":"Pandoras_Box_DVD_1_of_3","subject":["Pandora's Box","Adam Curtis","documentary","technocracy"],"format":["MPEG2","Metadata"],"collection":["feature_films","moviesandfilms"]},{"title":"Snowbeast","description":"A Colorado ski resort is besieged by a sub-human beast that commits brutal murders on the slopes. - IMDB Description","avg_rating":3.33,"identifier":"Snowbeast_436","subject":["Horror","Yvette Mimieux","Movie Powder","avi"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"Jacare","description":"Psudo-Documentary of the Amazon Jungle with many staged action sequences and hepitological herpetological errors.","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"Jacare_ipod","subject":["action, documentary"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","QuickTime","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Non Stop New York 1937","description":"Anna Lee is a stowaway on a futuristic airliner.

This is, to some extent, understandable; I myself admit to a slight preference for the latter movie, and the blaxploitation angle certainly makes The Thing with Two Heads stand out from the two-headed-guy movie crowd in a way that The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant does not. But there really ought to be room in the hearts and minds of schlock-lovers for both films, and in that light, the eclipse of the earlier flick is unfortunate. For not only is The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant the prototype, it also has an entertainment advantage its younger brother lacks: The Thing with Two Heads has a certain cockeyed logic to it, while the underlying premise of this movie makes no damn sense at all. A short prologue establishes the character of serial rapist-murderer Manuel Cass (Albert Cole, from Angels’ Wild Women and the legendarily bad Al Adamson western The Female Bunch)— his crimes and his subsequent confinement to a hospital for the criminally insane. Then, we turn our attention to a man who probably isn’t a whole lot less crazy than Cass. Linda Girard (Pat Priest, best known for playing Marilyn on “The Munsters”) has just about had it with her husband, Dr. Roger Girard (Bruce Dern, from Silent Running and The Trip). Ever since he was drummed out of the hospital where he worked over some unexplained controversy regarding his private line of medical research, Roger has scarcely left the windowless confines of his basement laboratory, where he toils day and night with his assistant, Max (Barry Kroeger, of Nightmare in Wax and The Time Travelers), on some secret project or other. When the Girards’ friend, Dr. Ken Anderson (Casey Kasem, from The Dark and The Cycle Savages), drops by for a visit, Linda tells him she’s strongly considering leaving her reclusive, obsessed husband. She still loves the man, but she’s sick of trying to compete for his attention with his mysterious research. When Anderson offers to talk to Roger about Linda’s dissatisfaction, she thinks that would be a wonderful idea, and she immediately shows him downstairs to the lab. Once we (and Anderson) get a look inside, it becomes instantly comprehensible why Girard has been so hush-hush about everything. Girard’s lab is full of animals with two heads. Two-headed monkeys, two-headed rabbits, two-headed dogs— even a two-headed snake. Why? I don’t really know; Girard spends most of the next scene explaining it, but it didn’t make any sense to me. (I do know— or at least strongly suspect— that this scene was the inspiration for the mad scientist on “South Park” with all his four-assed critters.) In any event, Anderson gives his friend the heads-up that his wife might very well skip out on him if he doesn’t get out of the lab and start spending some time with her, and after getting Roger’s word that he’ll try to do better by Linda in the future, he heads off to work— at the very hospital from which Girard had been fired, incidentally. Meanwhile, we meet the other two members of the Girard household, caretaker Andrew Norton (Larry Vincent, from The Witchmaker and Dr. Death: Stealer of Souls) and his gigantic, retarded son, Danny (John Bloom, who played monsters for Al Adamson in Brain of Blood and Dracula vs. Frankenstein). When Girard was giving Anderson his nonsensical spiel about the purpose of his work, he said something about people with irreparable brain damage, so once we hear that Danny’s retardation stems from an incident in his childhood, when he was trapped by a cave-in in an abandoned mineshaft for long enough for his brain to be wrecked by oxygen starvation, it’s hard to escape the feeling that Danny is going to end up with somebody else’s head grafted onto his shoulder before this movie is through. And if you’ve guessed that that extra head is going to come from Manuel Cass, give yourself a gold star for the day. Cass breaks out of the asylum, steals a car, and drives out into the California countryside, down a road that will ultimately take him right to the Girard place. Max is in town for some reason, and Roger is predictably down in his lab, so when Cass arrives at the house, Linda is forced at first to confront him alone. When Roger and Andrew try to come to Linda’s rescue, Cass makes short work of them, tying Roger up and murdering Andrew before abducting Linda and driving off with her. Danny comes in soon thereafter, but he proves to be of little use, as he immediately collapses into shock upon seeing his father’s body. Thus, Linda’s rescue will have to wait for Max’s return from town. The two doctors grab a shotgun each, go driving off after Cass’s stolen ‘61 Comet, and eventually corner the psychopath not far from the entrance to the old mine. Roger shoots Cass in the back, then he and Max pack him and Linda up, and return home. The question now is, what to do with Danny? The big man is practically catatonic when the rest of the Girard household gets back, and neither Roger nor Max has much hope of him ever recovering. Now as it happens, Max has been getting itchy to try the head-graft technique out on a human subject— evidently, this research holds the key to him regaining the full use of his hands, which haven’t worked right in about ten years for reasons that are never explained. Sure, you and I might ask how Max thinks his gimp hands are going to profit from the successful grafting of a second head onto a high-grade moron, but you and I are not accomplished surgeons or medical researchers, and in any event, who the hell would pay good money to see a movie called The Incredible 4-Handed Transplant? Okay— I would, but still... Max points out that Cass isn’t quite dead yet, and that a catatonic retard and a homicidal maniac are of no real use to society as they are. But if Danny and Cass were used to further medical science for the benefit of all mankind (‘cause we all know how much mankind will benefit from having a bunch of two-headed guys running around), then their lives would finally be given some meaning. Evidently it never occurs to Roger that putting a psycho’s head on a colossal, superhumanly strong body probably isn’t a very good idea, because he sees Max’s point, and the next scene has the two men in the basement, performing the titular transplant. Roger explains Danny’s disappearance to Linda by claiming the distraught man-boy ran away during the night. So do you think Cass is going to be the first of our monster’s two heads to wake up? And do you think he’ll then use Danny’s immense strength to further his interrupted criminal career? Of course you do. And that is indeed exactly what happens. Danny’s feeble will is no match for the murderer’s, and he is forced to stand by as a traumatized spectator to his own killing spree as Cass has him attack Lovers’ Lane, a biker gang’s campsite, and finally the Girard household. Meanwhile, Ken Anderson has become suspicious of Roger’s increasing reclusiveness, especially once he hears that witnesses to the attack on Lovers’ Lane describe the perpetrator as a giant with two heads. Anderson teams up with the Sheriff (Jack Chester, of Die, Sister, Die!), and leads the police to Girard, whom he confronts with the information that the most recent product of his experiments has killed five people, in addition to kidnapping Linda once again. After the cops go off to follow the bloodhounds trailing the monster, Roger, Max, and Ken form their own posse, and head straight for what Roger thinks is the creature’s most likely hideout— the mine where Danny was trapped as a child. As a special bonus, the climax treats us not only to the expected monster fight, but also to one of the cheapest, most unconvincing cave-ins in cinema history.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":4.0,"identifier":"2headed_1971","subject":["Bruce Dern","drive-in","horror","monster movie","Sci-Fi","cult film","drive-in classics","Third Eye Cinema"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"Uncle Joe","description":"A film that's cheap, silly, and short.

This film was originally released on March 18 1910. From the Edison Kinetogram: Frankenstein, a young student, is seen bidding his sweetheart and father goodbye, as he is leaving home to enter a college in order to study the sciences. Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else. His great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it. To Frankenstein's horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room, only to have the misshapen monster peer at him through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him. After a few weeks' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. In other words, the story of the film brings out the fact that the creation of the monster was only possible because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein's coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride's room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein's feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house. When Frankenstein's love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror he see's the image of the monster reflected instead of his own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster's image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein's mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":3.0,"identifier":"Frankenstein_628","subject":["Early film","Silent films","Frankenstein","Thomas Edison","Charles Ogle"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["TheVideoCellarCollection","feature_films"]},{"title":"Hercules and the Captive Women","description":"This movie is not fully uploaded.

Dionysius doesn't expect Pythias to keep his end of the bargain, thus exposing the falsity of his beliefs, but Pythias proves to be a man of his word. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055885/","avg_rating":1.0,"identifier":"DamonandPythias1962","subject":["Ancient Greece","swords","pecs"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"The Girl in Lover's Lane","description":"\"Too Young to Know...Too Reckless to Care...\" Two drifters arrive in a small town and get into trouble immediately.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"Girl_In_Lovers_Lane","subject":["Jack Elam","Del Monroe","Drifters","B Movie","Crime"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Triumph of the Will (German: Triumph des Willens)","description":"Triumph of the Will (German: Triumph des Willens) is a propaganda film made by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including portions of speeches by Adolf Hitler, interspersed with footage of massed party members. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The overriding theme of the film is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the True German Leader who will bring glory to the nation. Triumph of the Will was released in 1935 and rapidly became one of the best-known examples of propaganda in film history. Riefenstahl's techniques, such as moving cameras, the use of telephoto lenses to create a distorted perspective, aerial photography, and revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography, have earned Triumph recognition as one of the greatest films in history.[1] Riefenstahl won several awards, not only in Germany but also in the United States, France, Sweden, and other countries. The film was popular in the Third Reich and elsewhere, and has continued to influence movies, documentaries, and commercials to this day.

Visionary and messenger of the Immaculate Conception, she told us the very words of the Virgin Mary, spoken in the native Basque tongue of Southern France and Northern Spain. She spoke words teaching of the merits of prayer, penance, poverty and church. In the first and most widely recognized Marian apparition of modern times, a personal message was delivered also to BernadetteShe would not find happiness in this world, but only in the next. She was to die twentyone years later in 1879 after a prolonged and painful illness. She remained hidden in a convent about 300 miles from home, a refuge from the interrogations and the pilgrims that never ceased seeking her. At thirtyfive, her strongwilled manner gave way to her frail body, and she finally entered into her eternal happiness. While she took with her the knowledge of certain secrets the Virgin gave her, one secret remained hidden in our presence. The most spectacular of all the incorruptibles, Bernadette's miraculously preserved body remained buried in a damp grave for thirty years until the cause for beatification was taken up. To this day, the body of Bernadette is a profound source of inspiration and of mystery surrounding the ways of the Lord. The face of Bernadette is one of surreal beauty, and will remain for us always the face that gazed into the eyes of the Mother of God. الإخوة الأحباء أضع بين أيديكم اليوم فيلماً رائعاً بكل ما تحمله من معاني كلمة رائع أكتب كلامي هذا وأنا احمل دموعي على خدي بعد أن أجهشت بالبكاء بعد مشاهدة هذا الفيلم الرائع الذي أثر في نفسي كثيراً لم أكن أدري أننا يجب أن نعاني لدخول ملكوت السموات وأدركت الآن أن رئيس العالم يحاول أن ينسيني أنني بضيقات كثيرة ينبغي أن أمر لكي أرث ملكوت السموات أذهلني كَم الألم والمعاناة التي عانتها هذه القديسة وكم الاتهامات والتشكيك من جانب الناس التي يحرّكها رئيس هذا العالم وبالمقابل الحب والبذل والهدوء والعلاقة السرية بينها وبين الإله الخالق. كم أشتاق أن يكون لي نفس هذه العلاقة الرائعة مع إلهي ومخلصي ، ولكن خطاياي التي أكتمها في قلبي خطاياي المحبوبة لنفسي مثل محبة إبراهيم لاسحق ولكن إبراهيم ضحى باسحق ولكني أرفض أن أضحي باسحاقي ، ارفض أن اضحي بخطيئتي لأني أجد فيها لذة ولم أجد في الله لذة سريعة. عندما شاهدت الفيلم وقصة هذا السيدة أدركت قيمة الله أو بالحري طلبت من الله أن يعطيني أن أدرك قيمته وغلاوته وحلاوة عشرته التي جعلت هذه المرأة تحتمل الأمراض الجسدية والاتهامات والهزء والتعيير بل وبعد كل هذا ترى نفسها لا تستحق الملكوت بل وأنها لم تفعل شيئاً أخجلني اتضاعها وفضح كبرياء المستتر بحلل الاتضاع الزائف أضع بين أيديكم صورة حية لقديسة عاشت وسطنا واضطهدها أناس ليسوا من الشارع وليسوا كفاراً بل رجال من الكنيسة لتكون لنا مثالاً أن نركِّز في شخص المسيح ولا نتأثر بأي شخص لا يسلك كما سلك المسيح بل نصلي من أجله ونثق أن كل أمورنا في يد الله نفسه وهو يهتم بنا كما يهتم الانسان بنفسه وبجسده يارب ارجوك بارك كل مَن يحضر هذا الفيلم ببركة روحية وافتح أذهاننا لأن الوقت المتاح لنا في هذه الحياة قصير جداً وهيئة هذا العالم ستزول ستزول ستزول أرجوك يارب افتح اعيننا لنرى ونصدق ونؤمن أننا سنغادر هذا العالم ولا نؤجل التوبة وأن نفضح أنفسنا بالاعتراف بخطايانا بدلاً من ننفضح أمام الخليقة كلها ونندم حيث لا ينفع الندم ونسكب الدموع الآن قبل أن يأتي وقت لا نجدها أصلي من أجلي نفسي بالدموع ومن أجل كل شخص يقرأ هذا الموضوع لنصلي جميعاً من أجل بعض ومن أجل العالم كله أن يعطينا الرب أذان صاغية لهمساته وقيرعه على قلوبنا جميعاً صلوا جميعاً من أجلي فيلم القديسة برناديت هاتان الصورتان هما للقديسة برناديت التي توفيت قبل 122 سنة ودفنت في لورد بفرنسا. لم يكتشف الجثمان الا قبل 30 سنة بعد ان قرر مسؤولو الكنيسة هناك معاينة الجثمان. لا يزال جثمان هذه القديسة البارة ناضرا كما لو ان صاحبته لم تمت. وان حدث وزرت لورد يوما فانك سترى الجثمان في الكنيسة. الجثمان لم يتفسخ لانه في حياتها كانت مريم العذراء تظهر لها دائما معطية لها رسائل ونصائح الى بني البشر حول الطريقة الصحيحة للعيش على الارض. حدثت العديد من المعجزات في هذا المكان ولا تزال تحدث.

http://www.latinseminary.org/saints/bern.jpg ولدت برناديت في يوم الأحد الموافق السابع من يناير عام 1844 في لورد وهي مدينة صغيرة على جبال البيرينيه في فرنسا الجنوبية، من أبوين فقيرين: فرنسيس سوبيرو وزوجته لويزا كاستيرو. وسُجّلت باسم برناديت – ماري سوبيروس. وخلال السنوات اللاحقة لمولدها رزق والداها بست أطفال أيضاً، مات ثلاثةً منهم. أُصيبت برناديت وهي بعد طفلة بسعال أليم (الربو) ولم تتمتّع برناديت بصحّة جيّدة وكانت قريبةً جداً من والديها وأخواتها واخوتها. وكان أهلها يحاولون مساعدتها بشتى الطرق. كانت لطيفة المعشر، دائمة الابتسامة بالرغم من ألمها والكل يحبها. عملت راعية غنم وهناك في قلب الطبيعة كانت تُصعد أجمل الصلوات للرب وللعذراء. وعاشت في مطحنة لكن بسبب الظروف الصعبة التي واجهت العائلة في هذه المطحنة والتي أدّت الى انخفاض كميّة وجودة الطحين وبالتالي عدد الزبائن، أُجبرت عائلة سوبيروس على ترك المطحنة والانتقال للعيش في منزل أكثر تواضعاً. وقام فرانسوا كلّ يوم بالبحث عن عمل وكانت أجرته ضئيلة جداً ما أدى الى عدم اعتنائه الصحيح بعائلته. وبسبب ذلك اضطرّت لويس سوبيروس الى مساعدة زوجها فذهبت الى العمل في حين قامت الابنة الكبرى برناديت بالاعتناء بالأطفال. صورة عائلة برناديت http://www.bakhdida.net/munaiso/lord_files/image001.jpg صورة عديدة لبروفيل لبرناديت http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/2cf2b3f3a5.jpg ضعف ذاكرتها جعلها تتعذب كثيراً لتتلقن مبادئ التعليم الديني المسيحي على الرغم من أن الناس حاولوا اعطاء برناديت دروساً في الانجيل لكن كان من الصعب حدوث ذلك نظراً لعدم توفّر الوقت الكافي لها. تمتّعت هذه الفتاة بالإيمان العميق وصلاتها الدائمة البسيطة التي كانت بحوزتها باستمرار عادت برناديت إلى أهلها بعد أن أمضت سنين عديدة لدى مربيتها في مدينة برتريس وهناك في لورد تلقت التعليم المسيحي مع رفيقاتها وتناولت سرّ الشركة (التناول). يا له من شعور رائع الرب الإله دخل فعلياً إلى قلبها!. يوم الثلاثاء، في الحادي عشر من شهر شباط 1858 ذهبت برناديت برفقة أختها وصديقتها لجمع الحطب قرب مغارة وهناك كانت المفاجأة الكبرى حيث ظهرت لها السيدة العذراء بينما كانت تستعد لعبور نهر صغير وراء رفيقاتها، أولاً بشكل ريح ثم بشكل امرأة جميلة تسحر القلوب بجمالها الفتّان. صلّت برناديت مسبحتها وهي مذهولة بجمال المرأة وعند آخر إشارة صليب اختفت المرأة، علمت أم برناديت بالأمر وحاولت إقناع ابنتها أنها لم تكن سوى تخيلات وطلبت منها عدم الذهاب الى المغارة ولكن برناديت كانت تصّر أنها لم تكذب وعادت إلى المغارة لأن المرأة طلبت منها العودة بعد خمسة عشرة يوماً. صورة للمغارة http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/a273681d2c.jpg وهكذا توالت ظهورات المرأة الجميلة لبرناديت وكان الناس يتقاطرون إليها من كل صوب منهم بدافع الفضول ومنهم للصلاة. كانت سذاجة برناديت وصدقها وحرارة صلاتها تؤثر كثيراً في من هم حولها وقد وعدتها العذراء بالراحة والسلام في الحياة الأبدية مع يسوع فقط ولم تعدها بالراحة هنا على الأرض. كان الناس يتزايدون حول المغارة يوماً بعد يوم مما خلق قلقاً واضطراباً لدى رجال الشرطة فبدءوا يستجوبون برناديت ويحاولون أن يشوهوا كلامها ولكن الناس كانوا يصدقون كلامها فدافعوا عنها بشدة. اضطهدها رجال السلطة كثيراً وعانت منهم كثيراً لدرجة أن بعضهم حاول تلفيق تهمة الجنون لها وإيداعها المصحة النفسية وكان هذا بدافع من الشيطان الذي يحاول أن يعطل عمل الله وسعيه لتبكيت الناس للتوبة. كانت العذراء وفي ظهوراتها لبرناديت تطلب منها دعوة الخطاة إلى التوبة والصلاة من أجلهم. وفي إحدى الظهورات وبينما كانت برناديت تصلي بحرارة مرت يدها فوق لهيب شمعة مضاءة وبقيت كذلك ربع ساعة ولم تحترق كما أفاد بذلك شاهد عيان. حفرت برناديت في الأرض بجانب المغارة بناءً لطلب السيدة وللحال خرج ماء حيث شربت منه برناديت وقد أصبح هذا النبع الصغير نبع نِعَم شفى الكثير من المرضى بالنفس والجسد ولم يزل حتى يومنا هذا. ومن الذين شفوا: طفل ابن سنتين كانت أمه قد قطعت الأمل بشفائه فلجأت إلى معونة العذراء، ورجل كان يعاني من عمى في عينيه وفتاة عمياء أُعيد لها البصر. صورة نبع المياه http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/e8a87fdfdc.jpg وكانت الجموع تحتشد في ذلك المكان مصلّية من أعماق قلوبها الألوف من السلام الملائكي. بناءً لطلب كاهن الرعية الذي كان قد قال لبرناديت أن تسأل عن اسمها أجابت: \"أنا الحبل بلا دنس\". أي أنها النقية الطاهرة التي حضّرها الآب لتكون يوماً أماً لإبنه وقد طلبت العذراء بناء كنيسة في ذلك المكان وبالفعل بُنيت الكنيسة حيث يحتفل آلاف المؤمنين بالصلاة والافخارستيا في كل مرة. لقد تمّ فحص مياه النبع مرات عديدة ولكن لم يستطع أحد اكتشاف سر قوتها، إنها قدرة العذراء الكلية القداسة. قدمت برناديت ذاتها بكليتها إلى الله ودخلت دير راهبات المحبة حيث عملت في خدمة المرضى والأطفال وكانت راهبة متفانية في بذل ذاتها بمحبة وتقوى. وفي آخر حياتها بقيت مريضة لمدة خمس سنوات، تناجي حبيبها يسوع وأمها العذراء بحب وفرح وسلام داخلي إلى أن انتقلت إلى لقائهما الأبدي في السادس عشر من نيسان سنة 1879 وقد منحها الله نعمة كبيرة بأن قد بقي جسدها سالماً طرياً وكأنها ماتت منذ يوم وهو معروض في نعش زجاجي داخل كنيسة دير راهبات المحبة. وفي كانون الأول 1933 أُعلِن قداستها وأصبحت مدينة لورد مكاناً مقدساً يقصده المؤمنون من كافة العالم لينالوا النعم ويصلّوا للعذراء البريئة من الدنس ويطلبون شفاعة برناديت، تلك الفتاة التي كانت مطيعة لكلمة الرب في حياتها وقد انتقتها العذراء لتنقل إلينا رسالتها وتدعونا من خلالها للتوبة والقداسة. الله يختار الضعفاء والمتواضعين ليُظهر قدرته وحبّه وعظمته. لنكن متواضعين كبرناديت ونتشبّه بالقديسين في اتضاعهم، حتى نصل إلى القداسة صورة للمغارة وتمثال العذراء http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/e6d0993500.jpg تواريخ الظهورات التي حدثت في لورد لبرناديت سوبيروس الظهور الأول في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الحادي عشر من فبراير عام 1858 خرجت برناديت سوبيروس البالغة من العمر 14 سنة، وأختها تيونيت 12 سنة، وصديقتهم الصغيرة جانّيه أبادي 13 سنة لجمع الأخشاب. فمشوا الى مازابييل ورأوا هناك كهفاً أمامه جدول مياه. وبينما كانت تهمّ برناديت سوبيروس بخلع حذائها وجواربها لتعبر الجدول، سمعت صوت عصفة ريح. وتكرّر هذا الصوت مرة أخرى، عندها نظرت الى الكهف فرأت سيدة جميلة مكتسية بفستان أبيض وحزام أزرق وزهرتين على قدميها. وأشارت السيدة الى برناديت بإصبعها للاقتراب منها. تجمّدت برناديت في مكانها وحاولت بشكل تلقائي سحب المسبحة والركوع ورسم إشارة الصليب على وجهها. إلا أنّها لم تستطع القيام بذلك حتّى قامت السيدة التي تحمل مسبحة ذات صليب كبير ومُشع بعمل إشارة صليب. وفي أثناء صلاتها رأت برناديت السيدة وهي تُفلت خرزات المسبحة الواحدة تلو الأخرى لكن دون أن تحرّك شفتيها. دامت هذه الرؤية نحو 15 دقيقة. ولم تلحظ الفتيات الأخريات أي شيء من هذه الرؤية لكن برناديت أخبرتهم بما حدث كما أطلعت والدتها على ذلك. الظهور الثاني في لورد – يوم الأحد الموافق الرابع عشر من فبراير عام 1858 يوافق هذا اليوم عيد كنسي ، وقد انتاب برناديت شعورٌ يحتّم عليها الذهاب الى الكهف بالرغم من معارضة والدتها لهذا الأمر. وبعد محاولات عديدة لإقناع أمّها، نجحت برناديت وهمّت بالذهاب إليه مع صديقتيها وأخذت معها زجاجة مليئة بالماء المقدّس لرشّه على العذراء إذا رأتها مرة أخرى هناك. وعند وصولهنّ الى الموقع ركعن وصلّين المسبحة. رأت برناديت السيدة العذراء وبيدها السبحة فقامت برشّ الماء المقدّس باتّجاهها وقالت لها: \"إن جئت من عند الله، فابقي. وإن لم تكوني من عنده فاذهبي بعيداً\". وحينما كانت ترش برناديت الماء المقدس أكثر كانت السيدة العذراء تبتسم أكثر فأكثر. وحينما فرغت الزجاجة من الماء واصلت برناديت الصلاة واختفت السيدة العذراء. الظهور الثالث في لورد- يوم الثلاثاء الموافق الثامن عشر من فبراير عام 1858 في الصباح الباكر ركعت برناديت في الكهف. وذهب معها بعضٌ من البالغين من القرية وأعطوها قلماً وورقة. دخلت برناديت الى الكهف وطلبت من السيدة التالي: \"اكتبي لي اسمك على هذه الورقة لو سمحتي\". وكان ذلك ما طلبه منها الناس. وقد سمعت برناديت الإجابة: \"ذلك ليس ضروريّاً\". ثم قالت لها السيدة: \"هل ستكونين صالحة بما فيه الكفاية لتأتي الى الكهف على مدى خمسة عشر يوماً؟\". فأجابت برناديت: \"نعم، أعدك\". ووعدتها العذراء بالتالي: ثم قالت لها السيدة: \"أرغب برؤية الكثير من الناس هنا\". وكانت هذه المرة الأولى التي تسمع بها برناديت وبوضوح صوت العذراء المقدّسة العذب. وقد دام هذا الظهور أقل من نصف ساعة. الظهور الرابع في لورد – يوم الجمعة الموافق التاسع عشر من فبراير عام 1858 لم تعد برناديت سوبيروس خائفةً من الذهاب الى كهف مازابييل وشعرت بانجذاب روحيّ يحثّها على التوجّه إليه. كما ذهب معها ست أو سبع نساء من بينهنّ خالة برناديت. وبعد تلاوتهنّ للسلام المريميّ لثلاثة مرّات ظهرت العذراء ودام ذلك لنصف ساعة. وفي ذلك اليوم أخذت برناديت معها شمعة مباركة وهو شيء اعتادت القيام به كل يوم على مدى الأربعة عشر يوماً التي ظهرت فيهم العذراء والذي وافق الأخير فيه الثالث من مارس من عام 1858. الظهور الخامس في لورد – يوم السبت الموافق العشرين من فبراير عام 1858 اجتمع مع برناديت في هذا اليوم ما يقارب الثلاثين شخصاً. تكرّرت الرؤية وعند انتهائها قالت برناديت بنفسها المطمئنّة القليل عن الرؤية. قالت وبوضوح أنها ولمرّة أخرى شاهدت \"السيدة الجميلة\"، التي ابتسمت لها وهي داخل الكهف. الظهور السادس في لورد- يوم الأحد الموافق الواحد والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 حضر في هذا اليوم ما يقارب المئة شخص الى الكهف مع برناديت وقد أدركوا تماماً مدى التأني في حركات برناديت. ظهرت العذراء لتنظر الى الجمع بعينيها المتلألئتين وقالت: \"صلّوا الى الخطاة\". وكان على برناديت تحمّل المقابلة الطويلة التي حدثت بعد ظهر ذلك اليوم مع مفوّض الشرطة جاكومي. وبقيت مع ذلك هادئة وجعلها أباها تعده بأن لا تذهب الى ذلك الكهف مرة أخرى. الظهور السابع في لورد – يوم الثلاثاء الموافق الثالث والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 قال الأب بوميان أن لا حقّ لأي أحد أن يمنعها من الذهاب الى الكهف. وفي ذلك اليوم كان هناك ما يقارب المئة شخص على الأقل من بينهم الدكتور دوزوس والكثير من الشخصيّات المهمّة في المدينة الصغيرة. وقد علّمت السيدة المقدّسة برناديت صلاة قصيرة ومميّزة والتي احتفظت بها لنفسها وقامت بصلاتها كل يوم الى أخر حياتها. كما وأملت عليها العذراء بعض التعليمات مفادها: \"اذهبي الى القساوسة وقولي لهم أنني أريد أن تُبنى كنيسة هنا\". الظهور الثامن في لورد – يوم الأربعاء الموافق الرابع والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 حضر الى الكهف نحو مئتين أو ثلاثمئة شخص ورأوا وجه برناديت والحزن بادٍ عليه وقد زحفت بركبتيها على الأرض وتوقّفت عدّة مرات لتتمتم؛ الكفّارة...الكفّارة... الكفّارة.... وقد قالت بعد ذلك، أنّ السيدة طلبت منها القيام بذلك كتكفير عن الخطأة. يا قديسة مريم.. صلّي لأجلنا نحن الخطأة الظهور التاسع في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الخامس والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 امتلأ الكهف ولمرّة أخرى بالناس. وقد بدى مظهر برناديت في هذا الظهور غريباً نظراً لما قالته لها العذراء: \"ابنتي، أريد أن أخبرك بسرّ أخير يخصّك، لا يجب أن تبوحي به لأحد. والآن اذهبي اشربي واغتسلي من النبع وكلي العشب النابت بجانبه. وأشارت العذراء مريم الى الكهف. ورأت برناديت ماءً قذرة موحلة لم تستطع الشرب منها. حاولت لثلاثة مرات أن تحفر بعمق أكثر فأكثر. وفي المحاولة الرابعة استطاعت أن تشرب من الماء وغسلت نفسها ثم أكلت من العشب. قال بعض الحاضرين أنها مجنونة لكن بعد أن حفرت برناديت في ذلك المكان انبثقت مياه غزيرة. وأصبح يسع ذلك النبع لمئة ألف لتر من الماء يومياً. وأطلق عليه الكثير من الناس \"ماء المعجزة\". وفي ذلك اليوم خضعت برناديت للاستجواب من قبل القائد الملكي ام. دوتور. لكن لم يحصد المحقّقون أي معلومات من هذا الاستجواب. صورة نبع المياه http://iraq8.com/up/uploads/743b205ebe.jpg الظهور العاشر في لورد – يوم السبت الموافق السابع والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 حضرالظهور العاشر ما يقارب 800 شخص. وقامت برناديت لمرة أخرى بشرب مياه النبع المتدفّقة وأكلت من العشب القريب منه. الظهور الحادي عشر في لورد – يوم الأحد الموافق الثامن والعشرين من فبراير عام 1858 تبع ما يقارب الألف ومئة وخمسون شخصاً برناديت الى الكهف. وحضر رئيس ضباط العسكر مع سكرتيرته من تارب. تأثّرت برناديت بذلك وقالت أن الرؤية قد دامت لمدة أطول. وبعد الظهر تم استجوابها مرة أخرى من قبل الضابط الملكي ورئيس الشرطة. كما وحضر مدير المدرسة العليا المحليّة لطرح الأسئلة عليها بشكل انفراديّ. وقد اعتقد أنها كانت تعاني من الجُمدّة قبل أن يطرح عليها الأسئلة وبعدها أصبح متيقّناً أنّ الظهورات قد حدثت لها فعلاً. الظهور الثاني عشر في لورد – يوم الاثنين الموافق الأول من مارس عام 1858 تبعاً لإحصاءات الشرطة حضر في ذلك اليوم ما يقارب الألف وخمسمائة شخص. قامت برناديت مرة أخري بشرب الماء والاغتسال من النبع. وكان اليوم الأول الذي يحضر فيه القسّيس آبي ديزيرات الذي رسم كاهناً حديثاً والآتي من بلدة أوميكس الصغيرة القريبة من مازابييل. راقب هذا الكاهن برناديت بدقّة وعن قرب ثم قال بعد ذلك:\"ما هذا السلام التي تتحلّى به هذه الفتاة، ما هذه السكينة! وما هذه القداسة الرائعة! إن ذلك مستحيل بالنسبة الى طفلة لتقوم بذلك كلّه؛ إنها نقيّة وطاهرة، وجميلة أيضاً. لقد شعرت وكأنّني واقفٌ على عتبة السماء\". الظهور الثالث عشر في لورد – يوم الثلاثاء الموافق الثاني من مارس عام 1858 حضر في هذا اليوم ألفٌ وستمائة وخمسون مشاهداً. وسمعت برناديت العذراء تقول: \"اذهبي واطلبي من القسّيسين بناء كنيسة. أريد من الناس أن يأتوا الى هنا \". وعندما رأت برناديت الأب بيرامال كانت معاملته فظّة جداً ونسيت أمر الكنيسة تماماً. وعند عودتها الى القسّيس في المساء لتقول له ولثلاثة أخرين بقيّة الرسالة كانت ترتجف. وطلب منها قسّيس الأبرشية أن تسأل السيدة أولاً عن اسمها. الظهور الرابع عشر في لورد – يوم الأربعاء الموافق الثالث من مارس عام 1858 في صباح ذاك اليوم حضر الى الكهف ما يقارب الثلاثة آلاف الى الأربعة آلاف شخص، لكن لم يحدث أي شيء. عادت برناديت الى المكان بعد الظهر وبوجود مئة شخص رأت العذراء. وكما طلب منها قسّيس الأبرشيّة قامت بسؤال السيدة عن اسمها. ابتسمت السيدة دون أن تتفوّه بأي كلمة. فعادت برناديت لرؤية قسّيس الأبرشيّة، والذي بدوره قال لها بأنها ضعيفة وطلب منها مرة أخرى أن تسأل السيدة عن اسمها. الظهور الخامس عشر في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الرابع من مارس عام 1858 يوافق هذا اليوم يوم التسوّق في لورد كما أنه اليوم الأخير في الأيّام الخمسة عشر المذكورة في الظهور الثالث. توجّه ما يقارب العشرون ألف شخص نحو الكهف. وقد ساندت الشرطة قوّات أخرى من القرى المجاورة للمحافظة على الأمن. وظلّت برناديت سوبيروس ثلاثة أرباع الساعة داخل الكهف وحين خروجها توجّهت لرؤية قسّيس الأبرشيّة وقالت له أن السيدة ابتسمت ما أن سألتها عن اسمها، لكنها ما زالت تريد أن تُبنى كنيسة هنا. لكن بيرامال كرّر ما طلبه سابقاً وحتّم على برناديت سؤال السيدة عن اسمها. تبع ذلك توقّف في الظهورات، دام عشرين يوماً. وخلال ذلك لم تذهب برناديت الى الكهف ولم تشعر بشيء يقودها الى الذهاب الى هناك. وكانت هذه الفترة وقفة محبّبة لها من أجل استعادة الطمأنينة داخلها. كما وعادت الى المدرسة وهيّأت نفسها للمناولة الأولى. الظهور السادس عشر في لورد – يوم الخميس الموافق الخامس والعشرين من مارس عام 1858 يوافق هذا اليوم عيد البشارة. لم تستطع برناديت الذهاب الى الكهف لثلاثة أسابيع. وقد انتابها في ليل الرابع والعشرين والخامس والعشرين من شهر مارس شعور قويّ يحتم عليها الذهاب الى كهف مازابييل. وفي الساعة الخامسة صباحاً، حضر عدّة أشخاص من بينهم رئيس الشرطة الى الكهف. وما أن وصلت برناديت رأت السيّدة. وسألتها عن اسمها مكرّرةً هذا السؤال ثلاث مرّات. ابتسمت لها السيدة ثم تملّكت برناديت الشجاعة لسؤالها عن اسمها للمرة الرابعة! بعد ذلك كان هناك أيضاً توقّف في الظهورات الظهور السابع عشر في لورد – يوم الأربعاء الموافق السابع من أبريل عام 1858 ذهبت برناديت سوبيروس للاعتراف فتوقّع الناس منها الذهاب الى الكهف. وقامت بذلك كعادتها حاملةً معها شمعة مضاءة في يدها اليسرى، وبيدها اليمنى قامت بحماية الشعلة من الرياح. وأثناء انجذابها الروحيّ الذي دام خمس عشرة دقيقة. اتّجه اللهب نحو أصابعها لم يلحظ الدكتور دوزوس أي حرق على يدها وآمن بأن برناديت رأت حقاً العذراء. تبع ذلك أطول توقّف حدث بين الظهورات. الظهور الثامن عشر في لورد – يوم الجمعة الموافق السادس عشر من يوليو عام 1858 في يوم عيد تجلّي العذراء الكرمليّ، شعرت برناديت بحافز يحثّها على الذهاب الى الكهف. فذهبت في الثامنة مساءً الى هناك. حيث قامت السلطات في الظهور السابق بإغلاق الكهف اتباعاً للمرسوم الصادر في العاشر من يونيو عام 1585 والذي ينصّ على إغلاق المكان. ركعت برناديت على الضفة الأخرى من نهر غايف مع خالتها لوسيل. وبفترة قصيرة انجذبت روحيّاً بعمق كما حدث لها من شهور قليلة سابقة. وحينما سُئِلَت بعدها عن الذي قالته لها العذراء، أجابت: \"لا شيء\"، لكنّها قالت أنها لم تشاهد العذراء بهذا القدر من الجمال من قبل كالذي شاهدته في هذه المرة. وبعد هذا الظهور، عادت برناديت الى حياتها الطبيعيّة المؤمنة المتمثّلة بالإخلاص الكامل الى الرب لبقية حياتها. وقع الظهور الأول لهذه الظهورات الثمانية عشر للسيدة العذراء في لورد في الحادي عشر من فبراير من عام 1858. وخلال هذه الظهورات وبعدها أصبحت برناديت محطّ إعجاب الكثيرين كشخص مهم كما وابتعد أيضاً الناس عنها! ووجد أهلها صعوبةً في ذلك فكيف لهؤلاء الناس الفقراء الدفاع عن أنفسهم أمام ضغوطات العامّة المهدّدة لهم! لكن برناديت ومع ذلك بقيت محافظةً على طبيعتها المتّسمة بالبساطة والأمانة والمكرّسة لله. بقيت هادئة ومتقبّلة للاستهزاء الظاهر على وجوه المحقّقين الآتين من الكنيسة والسلطات، مقدّمةً مقاومة واضحة في وجه محاولاتهم وإصرارهم الفظ على تكرار ما حدث أثناء الظهورات. زاد ذلك كلّه من رغبة برناديت بأن تصبح راهبة فقرّرت الدخول الى دير نيفيرس. ونظراً لضعف صحّتها التي لا تخوّلها الى اتّباع القوانين الصارمة، أحبّت برناديت الاعتناء بالمرضى كما أنها قالت: \"لا أحد حاول إجباري على الذهاب الى الدير\". برناديت سوبيروس في نيفيرس في يوليو عام 1866، قامت برناديت بالالتحاق بدير أخوات محبة نيفيرس في سان غيلدارد، وهو مقرّ الأبرشيّة، آملةً في إشباع رغبتها المتمثّلة في تكريس حياتها الى الله. وقبل أن تترك لورد وعائلتها الحبيبة ذهبت برناديت الى الكهف في الرابع عشر من يوليو عام 1866. أخبرت الأخت ماري- برناديت في بداية حياتها الرهبانية جميع الراهبات بقصة الظهورات بكاملها والتي لم يُسمح لها بعد ذلك بذكر شيء عنها. أعطت بعض الراهبات الأرفع مقاماً برناديت أعمالاً وضيعة وعانت كثيراً من الإذلالات إلا أنها قبلت ذلك كلّه بصدر رحب. وقد أُعطيت مهام غرفة مشفى الدير، حيث أصبحت ممرضة ممتازة لكنها كانت تعاني من الربو كما أصيبت بالسل وفقدت الكالسيوم من عظامها وامتلأ جسمها بالجروح، واجتمعت معاناة المرض مع المعانات العقليّة لتعيش بذلك كل يوم. وما ذلك إلا تحقيق لطلبت السيدة العذراء السابق في لورد: \"صلّي للخطأة وكفّري عن الخطايا\". \"أعد أن أجعلكِ سعيدة، ليس في هذا العالم، بل في العالم الآخر\" توفيت برناديت يوم الأربعاء الموافق 16 أبريل عام 1879 عن عمر يناهز الخامسة والثلاثين. وقد زادت قوّتها الإيمانية وهي على فراش الموت وبعد عملية طويلة مضنية وبأمر من الكنيسة أٌعلنت الأخت ماري برناديت قديسة في الثامن من ديسمبر عام 1933. وقد بقي جسدها سليماً وحفظ في ضريح زجاجيّ في كنيسة الدير في نيفيرس. ملاحظتي الشخصية عن لورد وعلاقتها القوية مع الأخت ماري-برناديت: لم تكن برناديت تعرف معنى بعض العبارات التي قالتها السيدة العذراء . فقد كانت مجرّد فتاة صغيرة أمينة وصادقة. ومن الرائع أن تختارها السيدة العذراء. ومع أن الظهورات لم تجلب لها سوى المعاناة! إلا أن العالم في لورد قد بورك من جراء ذلك. كما يتدفّق أكثر من خمسة ملايين شخص كل سنة وهو شيء ليس بغريب. فعندما أقفل محافظ البلدية الكهف طلب منه مطران تاربي إعادة فتحه وقال: \"فقط الامبراطور يستطيع إعادة فتح الكهف. دعنا نرى من هو الأقوى، السيدة العذراء أم الإمبراطور؟\". وقد قام الامبراطور نابوليون الثالث بإعادة فتح الكهف، بطلب مكرّر وملح من الامبراطورة أوجين. صورة كاتدرائية لورد

The story concerns a real life bushranger (outlaw) named Captain Starlight, who became a national hero (like Ned Kelly). It is based on a classic Australian novel by Rolf Boldrewood (the pen name of Thomas Browne). This was the third film of the novel. The first, directed by Charles McMahon, was an early feature film made shortly after \"The Story of the Kely Gang\". The second was made in 1911. The 1957 Rank Organisation production starring Peter Finch was one of the most popular Australian films of the 1950s. It was again remade as a TV mini-series in 1985 starring Sam Neill. The 1920 version is one of the few surviving independently produced Australian silent films. This version comes from a video tape released by the New South Wales Department of Education, Sydney in 1984. This is from a multi-generational VHS copy. I have put the video through as much video noise reduction as I could without effecting the image. Its not very good quality but this is a decent movie and a valuable artifact.

Ashkan Synopsis: Iranian musicians Negar and Ashkan look for band members to play at a London concert ... and the visa that allows them to leave Tehran to do so... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1426378/ Konusu: “Kasi Az Gorbehaye Irani Khabar Nadareh” (Kimse Iran kedilerinden bahsetmiyor) filminde Tahran’da kaçak olarak rock, rap ve metal gibi bati müzikleri yapan gençlerin müzik serüvenleri ile Iran’da yasayan gençligin macerasini beyazperdeye tasiyan Kürt yönetmen, son derece çarpici ve etkileyici anlatim yakaliyor. Çünkü Islam’da müzik, zevk ve mutluluk uyandirdigi için günah kabul edilerek yasaklaniyor. Cannes Film Festivali’nin ‘Un certain regard’ bölümünün açilis filmi olarak seyirci ile bulusan ünlü Kürt Yönetmen Bahman Ghobadi’nin “Kasi Az Gorbehaye Irani Khabar Nadareh” (Kimse Iran kedilerinden bahsetmiyor) isimli filmi festivalde yogun ilgi ile karsilandi. Uluslararasi Cannes Film Festivali’nde 2000 yilinda “Sarhos Atlar Zamani” isimli ilk uzun metrajli filmi ile “altin kamera” ile “uluslararasi elestiri” ödüllerini almis olan Bahman Ghobadi’nin bu yil “Un certain regard” bölümünün açilis filmi olan “Kimse Iran kedilerinden bahsetmiyor” isimli filmi ayakta alkislandi. Bu filminde Tahran’da kaçak olarak rock, rap ve metal gibi bati müzikleri yapan gençlerin müzik serüvenleri ile Iran’da yasayan gençligin macerasini beyazperdeye tasiyan Ghobadi, Iran’daki son derece çarpici ve etkileyici anlatim yakaliyor. Çünkü Islam’da müzik zevk ve mutluluk uyandirdigi için günah kabul edilerek yasaklaniyor. Kadin sesi de insani duygulandirdigi için günah sayiliyor. Bu yüzden Iran’da kadinlarin kamu alaninda sarki söylemesi ve gençlerin batili enstrümanlarla müzik yapmalari “Islam’a ve toplumun ahlakina aykiri oldugu” gerekçesiyle yasaklanmis. Batili enstrümanlarla veya politik içerikli ve toplumsal degerleri sorgulayici müzik yapmalarinin yasak oldugu Iran’da yüzlerce müzisyen tutuklanarak hapse atiliyor. Ancak tutuklamalar ve hapis cezalarina ragmen gençler ve kadinlar büyük bedeller ödeyerek müzik yapmaya devam ediyorlar. AHIRDA INEKLERLE BIRLIKTE ROCK MÜZIGI Ama nerede, nasil ve hangi kosullarda? Iste internet ve teknoloji çaginda, bütün yasaklara ragmen Islamci yasalarin sanat yapilmasini engelleyemedigini gözler önüne seren “Kasi Az Gorbehaye Irani Khabar Nadareh”, gençlerin yasaklar yüzünden ahirlarda hayvanlarin içerisinde, bodrumlarda ve insaatlarda müziklerini yapmaya çalistiklarini çarpici bir sekilde perdeye yansitiyor. En büyük hayalleri müzik gruplari ile konserler vermek olan genç çift Askin ve Nager’in (Nigar) tanistiklari Nader (Nadir) ile Tahran’da yer altinda yapilan müzige dogru bizi heyecanli bir yolculuga çikaran yönetmen, Islamci yasaklarin egemenligi altindaki Tahran’da son derece ilginç bir yolculuga çikariyor. Bu yolculuk boyunca akan hareketli müzik adeta Dogu’nun kalbinde Iran kiyafetleri içerisinde Bati enstrümanlari ve söylem biçimleri ile olusmus rock, rap ve metal gibi müziklerle bir isyan çigligina dönüsüyor. Müziklerin ritim ve melodilerinin yani sira içerik açisindan da son derece özgün olusu, edebi yapilari ve felsefeleri ile sarsici bir etki yaratmasi dikkat çekiyor. Bu müziklerle birlikte yansiyan görüntüler de çarpici bir kontrast yaratarak son derece hareketli bir mizah ile orijinal bir anlatim yakaliyor. Daha önce altin kamera ödülü alan Ghobadi’nin kendine özgü anlatiminda imajin dili ve estetigi ile Dogu’nun en özgün yönetmenleri arasinda yerini aldigi artik kusku götürmüyor. Ayrica yönetmenin mizahindaki derinlik de anlatima eklenince unutulmayacak bir Dogu-Bati sentezi filmi ortaya çikiyor. KÜÇÜK KAMERA ILE MUCIZELER YARATMAK Iran’da 35 milimetrelik kamera kullanimi için özel izin gerektigi için ve böyle bir film için de izin alamadigi için çekimlerini bir “S12K” kamera alarak yapan yönetmen, burada küçük bir kamera ve küçük bütçeler ile de mucizeler yapilabilecegini kanitliyor. Tahran’da çekilecek bir filmi için 2 yil çalistigini ancak izin alamadigini belirten yönetmen, bu yüzden iki yil kaybettigini ve sonuçta bu filmi küçük kamera ile izinsiz bir sekilde çekmek zorunda kaldigini dile getiriyor. Simdiye kadar filmlerini Kürdistan’da çektigi için Iran hükümeti ve bazilari tarafindan “bölücü bir Kürt” olarak suçlandigini belirten Ghobadi, bu suçlamalarin “son derece aptalca” oldugunu vurguluyor. Bu filmi Tahran’da çekmek gerektigi için Tahran’da çektigini belirten yönetmen, Iran hükümetinin birçok filmine sansür uyguladigini ve bu filminin de Iran’da gösterileceginden emin olmadigini bildiriyor. Ayrica filmde oynayan müzisyenlerin yasamlari için de endiselendigini belirten yönetmen, filmde oynayan gençlerin bütün tehlikeleri göze alarak filmde yer aldigini kaydediyor, ancak endiselendiginin de altini çiziyor. BU FILMI KAÇIRMAYIN Iran’da yasaklara maruz kalanlarin sadece müzisyenler olmadigini bazi hayvanlara yönelik yasaklar oldugunu da filmde yansitan yönetmen, “Iran’da insanlar ne bir kedi ne de bir köpekle çikip seyahat edemez. Buna ragmen birçok insanin evinde kedi ve köpek bulunuyor ama bunlarin disari çikarilmasi yasak. Üstelik Iran kedileri de çok pahali kediler. Filmde görüldügü gibi yasaklar yüzünden gençler müziklerini yer altina çekilerek yapmak zorunda kalmalarini kedilerin de disari çikarilamamalari ile karsilastiriyorum. Bir de bu müzisyenlerle görüsmeye gittigimde kedilerin de isiga çikarak müzik dinlediklerini fark ettim” diyerek filmin isminin bu yasaklardan geldigini belirtiyor. Molla kepleri veya ilginç sakal ve kiyafetleri ile Batili enstrümanlarla müzik yapan gençleri Iran Islam rejiminin bu internet ve teknoloji çaginda nereye kadar engelleyecegi merak edile dursun, siz hiçbir yerde duyamayacaginiz ve ömrünüz boyunca bir daha unutamayacaginiz müzikler dinlemek istiyorsaniz bu filmi kaçirmayin.","identifier":"KasiAzGorbehayeIraniKhabarNadareh","subject":["Kasi","Az","Gorbehaye","Irani","Khabar","Nadareh","No","One","Knows","About","Persian","Cats"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Invisible Strangler","description":"A convicted strangler, studying the paranormal in his jail cell, learns to make himself invisible.

The horse identifies him to crooks Nick Kane and Bush Cleveland as killer-for-hire Mallory, and they promptly pay him $5000 to kill prospector Caleb Winters. Curious, the Kid goes to Winters and finds him hostile toward anyone wanting to buy his land and claim as he believes he will hit paydirt soon. Meanwhile, the real Mallory has contacted Deuce and sent him to shoot Winters on sight and get the $5000 back from the Kid. Unaware of this development, the Kid walks into Nick's trap (who can't find the money on him), and then into the hands of Sheriff Dave, who thinks he is Mallory. With the aid of his pals, Johnny (Ray Whitely) and Whopper, the Kid escapes, corrals Nick and the weasel-like Bush and herds them to Winter's cabin where Bush spills the truth. ======================================================== For a Free Download of Western Movies starring: Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, John Wayne, Johnny Mack Brown, Bill Steele, Rex Allen, Buster Crabbe, Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard, Tex Ritter, Zane Grey, etc. go to this URL: http://sites.google.com/site/moviesfreedownload/","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","identifier":"FargoKid1940-TimHolt","subject":["Tim Holt","RKO","western","cowboy","Feature Film","B Western"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"It Couldn't Have Happened, But It Did","description":"Playwright turns crimesolver when the play's two producers are murdered.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":3.33,"identifier":"It_Couldnt_Have_Happened","subject":["mystery","murder","poverty row"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Pandora's Box DVD 3 of 3 (containing Parts 5 and 6)","description":"(Click the \"MPEG2\" link on the left to download the NTSC DVD ISO file.) \"Pandora's Box was a six part 1992 BBC documentary television series written and produced by Adam Curtis, which examines the consequences of political and technocratic rationalism.\" (Wikipedia) Full Wikipedia article: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box_%28television_documentary_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box_%28television_documentary_series%29</a> More info about each episode, and links to the Torrents that were used to generate these DVDs: <a href=\"http://arttorrents.blogspot.com/2007/05/adam-curtis-pandoras-box-1992.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arttorrents.blogspot.com/2007/05/adam-curtis-pandoras-box-1992.html</a> This ISO file is an NTSC DVD that includes the last two 45-minute parts of the series: <b>Part 5: Black Power</b> <b>Part 6: A is For Atom</b> There are 2 other ISO files available, for a total of 6 parts: <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Pandoras_Box_DVD_1_of_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disc One</a> <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Pandoras_Box_DVD_2_of_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disc Two</a> Disc Three (this one) And why not <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=adam%20curtis\" rel=\"nofollow\">search for other things on archive.org by Adam Curtis</a>?

The decision to use an NTSC format was based on 2 factors: 1) This series was broadcast in the UK. Viewers in the U.S.A. will probably never see this on TV or via commercial DVD, due to the expense of licensing the archive footage. So by using an NTSC format, I hope that the work can more easily reach a North American audience. 2) NTSC discs can be played by almost all PAL players, but many NTSC players cannot play PAL discs (regardless of region-coding).","avg_rating":5.0,"identifier":"Pandoras_Box_DVD_3_of_3","subject":["Adam Curtis","Pandora's Box","documentary","technocracy"],"format":["MPEG2","Metadata"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Terror Is a Man","description":"The lone survivor of the sinking of the \"Pedro Queen,\" William Fitzgerald (Richard Derr) washes ashore on a remote Pacific island one thousand miles off the coast of Peru.

The decision to use an NTSC format was based on 2 factors: 1) This series was broadcast in the UK. Viewers in the U.S.A. will probably never see this on TV or via commercial DVD, due to the expense of licensing the archive footage. So by using an NTSC format, I hope that the work can more easily reach a North American audience. 2) NTSC discs can be played by almost all PAL players, but many NTSC players cannot play PAL discs (regardless of region-coding).","avg_rating":5.0,"identifier":"Pandoras_Box_DVD_2_of_3","subject":["Pandora's Box","Adam Curtis","documentary","technocracy"],"format":["MPEG2","Metadata"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Zis Boom Bah","description":"A rich former vaudeville mother tries to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible adult.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":1.0,"identifier":"zis_boom_bah","subject":["Comedy","Musical","Romance"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","HTML","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Shockwave Flash","Thumbnail","Unknown"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"The Devil's Partner (1958)","description":"An old man dies in his shack while performing satanic rites.

After 20 years absence, he returns as a middle-aged married man feeling trapped by marriage and tempted to re-visit his old haunts. As it often happens with legends, however, the Don Juan of the past has become far greater and more wonderful in women's minds than he ever was, especially when a young imitator is killed (by a jealous husband) and mistaken for Don Juan. Then a book entitled 'the Private Life of Don Juan' is published and read by swooning women, and the whole thing is reminiscent of our real larger-than-life legends such as Elvis. And as with Elvis, whom we prefer to remember as young, slim and handsome, so Don Juan lives in women's minds so that the real middle-aged Don Juan is treated like a kindly father-figure by young women - much to his dismay!","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","identifier":"ThePrivateLifeofDonJuan","subject":["Biography","Comedy","Drama","Romance","Douglas Fairbanks","Merle Oberon"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"CURSE OF KING TUTS TOMB 1980 TV MOVIE PART 1 OF 2","description":"CURSE OF KING TUT ON THOSE WHO DISTURB HIS RESTING PLACE","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"CURSEOFKINGTUTSTOMB1980TVMOVIEPART1OF2_0","format":["Video","512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Breakfast in Hollywood","description":"A comedy about many women in Hollywood who try to get noticed at Tom Breneman's popular radio show Breakfast in Hollywood. - Release Date: 02/26/1946 <a href=\"http://mystic-nights.com/videos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystic Nights Videos</a>","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":3.67,"identifier":"BreakfastInHollywood_961","subject":["Tom Breneman","Bonita Granville","Beulah Bondi","Edward Ryan","Raymond Walburn","Billie Burke","Zasu Pitts","Hedda Hopper","Andy Russell","Spike Jones","Nat 'King' Cole","Lillian Bronson","Mystic Nights Videos"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["Comedy_Films","feature_films"]},{"title":"The Bat (1926)","description":"A Silent film based upon the Broadway play by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, this Silent Gem was directed by Roland West in 1926, later being Remade as the Bat Whispers in 1930 (by Roland West) and again in 1958 in the Bat starring Vincent Price, also available at the Archive.

Duke Walter Brennen - Sheriffâs Deputy Bendix Story by William Colt MacDonald (Creator of The Three Mesqueteers stories) Made by Columbia Studios Written by pulp writer William Colt MacDonald, this Tim McCoy Columbia Studios Western may have been the forerunner of McDonald's later so popular The Three Mesqueteers. John Wayne, whose character is named, appropriately, Duke, and Wallace MacDonald (no relation to William Colt) play McCoy's loyal ranch hands, and although they remain in the background for part of the action, the germ of the triad hero is there. Tim McCoy plays a rancher losing his property to a crooked money-lender turned cattle rustler (Wheeler Oakman). The villain is in league with a sheriff's deputy (Walter Brennan) and together they rob the Wells Fargo. There is a final shootout and the dying deputy confesses to both the Wells Fargo heist and to the fact that Tim's ranch was illegally obtained. John Wayne, who didn't get along with Tim McCoy and had several rows with studio czar Harry Cohn, swore that he would never again work for Columbia, a promise he kept. ========================================================================== For a Free Download of Western Movies starring: Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, John Wayne, Johnny Mack Brown, Bill Steele, Rex Allen, Buster Crabbe, Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard, Tex Ritter, Zane Grey, etc. go to this URL: http://moviesfreedownload.googlepages.com/","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":3.0,"identifier":"TwoFistedLawWithTimMccoyAndJohnWayne1932","subject":["John Wayne","Tim McCoy","Feature Film","Western","William Colt MacDonald"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Lost, Lonely, and Vicious","description":"A young man's acting career takes off, but he becomes obsessed with death.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","avg_rating":2.67,"identifier":"Lost_Lonely_and_Vicious_1958","subject":["juvenile delinquent","youth","death wish"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Hurricane at Pilgrim Hill","description":"A Hal Roach comedy.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","avg_rating":4.6,"identifier":"Hurricane_at_Pilgrim_Hill","subject":["Hal Roach","comedy","Clem Bevans","Cecil Kellaway"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["Comedy_Films","feature_films"]},{"title":"The Joyless Street","description":"The film that brought international fame to both Pabst and Greta Garbo, THE JOYLESS STREET is a stinging indictment of the soullessness of Weimar-era Vienna. In the wake of World War I, the newly impoverished middle class becomes the prey of both black marketeers and the decadent upper classes. This whirlpool of economic ruin and moral decay is dramatized through the story of a middle-class family in decline. Garbo stars as a young woman who sells herself after her father makes a disastrous business decision. The story was considered too explosive by the Weimar government, which censored it heavily.

Katliami önlemede yetersiz kaldigi gerekçesiyle bölgedeki Hollanda baris gücü yogun sekilde elestirildi. Yapilan sorusturmada Hollanda baris gücü Sirp kuvvetlerin BM kampina girmelerini önleyememek ve Müslümanlar’i Sirplara teslim etmekten sorumlu bulmus, 2002'de Hollanda hükümeti de bundan dolayi istifa etmisti. Srebrenika, Bosna’da 1992-1995 arasindaki savasta vahsetin sembolü haline geldi. Bosna’da savas yüzbinlerce cana mal oldu ve savas sonunda Sirplarin zayif baglarla bagli oldugu ikili bir devlet yapisi ortaya çikti. Bosna, Müslüman-Hirvat Federasyonu’yla Bosna Sirp Cumhuriyeti’nden olusuyor. Bosnali Sirplar, katliamlar ortaya çikmasin diye toplu mezarlari buldozerlerle altüst ettigi için çogu ceset parçalanmis ve birbirlerine karismis halde. Adli Tip, halen çok sayidaki ceset parçasinin kime ait oldugunu tespit etmeye çalisiyor. Kimlik tespiti için DNA arastirmalari yapiliyor. Simdiye kadar 70'ten fazla toplu mezar bulundu. Srebrenika’da soykirim islendigi Uluslararasi Adalet Divani ve Eski Yugoslavya Için Uluslararasi Ceza Mahkemesi (ICTY) kararlariyla da sabit. A Cry from the Grave tells the story of the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, in which the Bosnian Serb army killed an estimated 7,000 Bosnian Muslims. It follows hour by hour the story of the killings. Through the testimony of survivors and relatives of those who died it explores the pain felt when no one is brought to justice.There are interviews with investigators from the UN-sponsored court at The Hague and from the UN special prosecutor. But the underlying message of the film is bleak indeed – no matter what is done, it will never be enough. A Cry from the Grave has won numerous prizes. It has been shown at the UN, and it was used during a war crimes trial at The Hague.","identifier":"ACryFromTheGrave","subject":["Srebrenica","A","Cry","From","The","Grave","solplatform"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Jim Hanvey, Detective (1937)","description":"An insurance company hires Private Detective Jim Hanvey to recover a stolen emerald necklace.","avg_rating":4.0,"identifier":"JimHanverDetective","subject":["Jim Hanvey","Detective","Mystery","Crime Drama"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Phantom Ship","description":"During a horrific storm at sea, the crew realizes that there is a murderer among them who is killing them off one by one. - IMDB Description","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","identifier":"PhantomShip","subject":["Mystery","Bela Lugosi","Movie Powder","avi"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","DivX","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"Angel and the Badman iPod version","description":"John Wayne plays Quirt Evans, a gunslinger with a nasty rep who is injured and nursed back to health by a Quaker family.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"angel_and_the_badman_iPod","subject":["western, romance, John Wayne"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"The Sun Sets At Dawn","description":"From <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044088/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDb</a>: \"A young man is wrongly convicted and sentenced to be executed.

The information in Zeitgeist was established over a year long period of research and the current Source page on this site lists the basic sources used / referenced and the developing Interactive Transcript includes exact source references and further information. A Q & A page is also being developed. Now, it's important to point out that there is a tendency to simply disbelieve things that are counter to our understanding, without the necessary research performed. For example, some information contained in Part 1 and Part 3, specifically, is not obtained by simple keyword searches on the Internet. You have to dig deeper. For instance, very often people who look up \"Horus\" or \"The Federal Reserve\" on the Internet draw their conclusions from very general or biased sources. Online encyclopedias or text book Encyclopedias often do not contain the information contained in Zeitgeist. However, if one takes the time to read the sources provided, they will find that what is being presented is based on documented evidence. Non-Profit DVDs / Free Video Downloads are available through the Downloads page. On October 2nd 2008 the sequel to Zeitgeist will premiere at the 5th Annual Artivists Film Festival in LA. The film will be presented for free online on Oct. 3rd. This feature length work will address the solutions to the problems presented in the original work.

Set in 1881, on the eve of British colonial rule, it is based on a true story: an Upper Egyptian clan had been robbing a cache of mummies near the village of Qurna, and selling the artefacts on the black market. After a conflict within the clan, one of its members went to the police, helping the Antiquities Service find the cache. The film casts this story in terms of the search for an authentic, lost Egyptian national identity (represented by the neglected and misunderstood artefacts of ancient Egyptian civilisation), but the conflict between city and countryside suggests questions that are not resolved in the film, making it an ambiguous, unsettling reflection on the price of identity. Unusual camera angles, striking colours and slow editing give the film a dreamlike quality, reinforced by Mario Nascimbene's eerie music. For those who know Arabic, the dialogue is entirely in classical Arabic, which adds to the sense of unreality.

This comes from when they were originally intended to be released as a double feature. \"Contrary to popular belief, this film was not directed by Kenneth G. Crane, was not made in 1970, was not produced by Toei Company, and was not titled \"The Double Garden\". It was originally filmed in 1966 as \"Body of the Prey\" and it was produced and directed by Norman Thomson. Thomson was the popular pulp novelist of the Burns Bannion series, which he wrote under his pen name 'Earl Thomson'. The production was assisted by members of the United States military bases in Japan and shot on location there. During production, Al Rickett wrote about the making of this film in the 'Stars & Stripes' newspaper, as well as having a small part as a gas station owner. However, while Edward D. Wood Jr. claimed he wrote the script for this film under the title \"Venus Flytrap\" and placed it on his resumes, reports of the making of the film in 'Stars & Stripes' claim Thomson wrote the script. It's possible that Wood sold the script to Thomson and it was slightly re-written before production. It's undetermined if the completed film was released theatrically, in either Japan or the United States.\" I have taken the liberty of replacing the credits with the data listed on the IMDb, footage from the Moody Institute's \"Carnivorous Plants,\" and a little music from \"Knife of the Party.\" I did it with my handy-dandy NERO. Since this created a NEW work under the law, despite being a simple combination of Public Domain works, I slapped a copyright notice on the back. Hack those off and the film belongs to everyone. Don't, and you have to let the world know I did the credits.

All of the available copies of this video came from the same deteriorated film. The original film may have been recorded from a collector's copy, or possibly from an old late night movie program. Various vendors have marketed copies all coming from the same source, and possibly from the same VHS copy. At last count there are several vendors, Alpha, Nostalgia Family Video, Anchor Videos, Vci Home Video and others. The older Nostalgia version is available in VHS while the Alpha version is a DVD. The Alpha DVD has slightly better black and white definition which gives the impression of more detail, but it has much much more noise. Both versions have the identical jumps, blackouts during scene changes, and film spots. But the Alpha DVD has enlarged the picture slightly which cuts off important details, and it has cut out parts of several scenes because of bad framing or blank picture. The Nostalgia video is a more complete version and appears to have slightly sharper picture with less noise. The original source was poorly transferred to VHS, or broadcast using old technology. In particular the video was poorly copied and the technician did not pay attention to the framing. The copy available here has been carefully transferred from a fairly complete VHS version. Using VirtualDub the video was stabilized and a large amount of the obtrusive noise was removed. The audio was carefully denoised with care taken to preserve the train sound effects. Obtrusive noises due to the deteriorated film were removed by hand. Some video jumps and the scene blackouts were corrected by hand, but some jumps due to missing frames can not be fixed. Blank video was filled in with adjacent frames or reasonable stills captured from adjacent frames. The bad framing was partially fixed, but could not be completely fixed with the available technology. A more carefully transferred version would be welcome. The result is a much more watchable copy of this movie. It may not be considered a \"classic\" film, but it has a number of good actors and is representative of Hollywood films of the mid '30s. It could even classify as an early science fiction because of the futuristic high speed monorail train. While the âtrainâ looked streamlined, the bloated size would cause large wind resistance, and severely limit its speed. Actually it was not really a train because it only had one car, so it might be considered to be a high speed street car. The futuristic interior design later appeared in many other science fiction films. The basic story concerns a tiff between a producer played by Victor Jory and his runaway star actress played by Evelyn Venable. The action mainly takes place on the Streamline Express, a high speed coast to coast monorail. Other stories are intertwined with the main story, and the usual Hollywood happy ending ensues, after some comical and suspenseful scenes.

R.c.m kökünden mastar, çoğulu “rucüm” dür. Aynı kökten “racîm”; recm olunan, taşlanan, kovulan ve lânetlenen anlamındadır. Zina edenin taşlanması Sünnet, ve icma delillerine dayanır. Zina bütün semavî dinlerde haram kılınmış ve çok kötü bir fiil olarak kabul edilmiştir. İslâm’da zina büyük günahlardan olup, ırz, namus ve neseplere yönelik olduğu için, cezası da hadlerin en şiddetlisidir. Zinanın cezası, fiili işleyenin evli veya bekâr oluşuna, İslâmî emir ve yasaklarla yükümlü bulunup bulunmamasına göre kısımlara ayrılır. Dayak, taşla öldürme, sürgün ve İslâm devleti’nin koyacağı ta’zir cezası bunlar arasındadır. The Stoning of Soraya M. is a 2008 American drama film adapted from French-Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam’s 1994 book of the same name based on a true story. Film tells the true story of one of the victims of stonings in modern Iran. Soraya M.’s husband Ghorban-Ali was an ambitious man, prone to rage with a lust for power. He wanted a way out of his marriage in order to marry a 14 year old girl but did not want to support two families or return Soraya’s dowry. When Soraya began cooking for a friend’s widowed husband, he found his excuse: abetted by village authorities, he accused his wife of adultery. She was taken away, buried up to her waist, and then stoned to death. Over the past fifteen years more than 1000 women have been stoned to death in Iran. Here is the true and shocking story of one such woman. سنگسار ثریا م. نام فیلمی به کارگردانی سیروس نورسته محصول ۲۰۰۸ آمریکا است. این فیلم بر پایه کتابی به همین نام (۱۹۹۴) نوشته فریدون صاحب جم ساخته شده و ماجرای آن در سال ۱۹۸۶ و در راستای نقض حقوق بشر در ایران اتفاق می‌افتد. شهره آغداشلو در نقش زهرا و جیم (جیمز) کاویزل -بازیگر فیلم‌های خط باریک قرمز (ترنس مالیک) و مصائب مسیح (مل گیبسون)- در نقش خبرنگار فرانسوی ظاهر شده‌اند. تهیه‌کننده اصلی این فیلم، کمپانی «ام‌پاورپیکچرز» است و فیلمنامه آن را سیروس نورسته به همراه همسر خود بتسی گیفن نورسته نوشته‌است. نورسته در مصاحبه‌ای گفته که فیلم سنگسار ثریا میم را در منطقه خاورمیانه ساخته، اما به کشور آن اشاره‌ای نکرده‌است. به گفته آغداشلو فیلم در اردن فیلمبرداری شده. سیروس نورسته فارغ‌التحصیل سینما از دانشگاه یو.اس.سی آمریکاست و سابقه بیست سال فعالیت تلویزیونی و سینمایی دارد. اما فیلم سنگسار ثریا م. نخستین فیلم سینمایی اوست. فیلمنامه این فیلم را بتسی نورسته همسرش نوشته که وی هم فارغ‌التحصیل فیلمنامه نویسی از دانشگاه میامی است. علاوه بر شهره آغداشلو و جیم کاویزل، پرویز صیاد، ویدا قهرمانی، نوید نگهبان، علی پورتاش و محمد یزدانی نیز در این فیلم بازی دارند. نقش ثریا را نیز بازیگر جوانی به نام مژان مارنو ایفا می‌کند. دیالوگ‌های سنگسار ثریا میم بیشتر به زبان فارسی است و فیلم با زیرنویس انگلیسی پخش جهانی می‌شود داستان فیلم از اینجا شروع می شود که روزنامه نگاری فرانسوی در سفرش به روستایی می رسد و اتومبیلش را برای تعمیر به هاشم، مکانیک روستا می دهد. توقف روزنامه نگار فرانسوی در روستا فرصتی است تا او با یک ماجرای هولناک مواجه شود؛ زنی به نام زهرا به محض دیدن روزنامه نگار او را به خانه خود دعوت می کند و از او می خواهد پای حرف هایش بنشیند. از این نقطه فیلم وارد یک فلش بک می شود و داستان در گذشته روایت می شود و خواهر زاده زهرا “ثریا” در مرکز این ماجرا قرار دارد. شوهر ثریا که یک زندان بان است قصد تجدید فراش دارد اما چون توانایی پرداخت هزینه هر دو زن را ندارد به ثریا پیشنهاد طلاق می دهد، ثریا وقتی حق و حقوقش را مطالبه می کند مرد نمی پذیرد و با کدخدا وروحانی ده تبانی می کند، نقشه از این قرار است که ثریا را به خانه هاشم برای کلفتی می فرستند، مردی که زنش را از دست داده و به همراه فرزند ناشنوایش زندگی می کند و این ویژگی ها موقعیت را برای متهم شدن ثریا به رابطه با هاشم فراهم می کند. شوهر ثریا با همدستی کدخدا و ملای ده به زن بی گناه اتهاماتی را نسبت می دهند که در نهایت به سنگسار شدن ثریا منجر می شود","identifier":"TheStoningOfSorayaM","subject":["The","Stoning","Of","Soraya","M"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police","description":"Captain Hugh (Bulldog) Drummond and his fiancée, Phyllis Clavering, are at his ancestral home preparing it for their wedding when a historian arrives to inform him of a hidden treasure within the castle.

It was shot in 1998 and was premiered at the Phoenix Picturehouse in Oxford on 26th November 1999. The film follows Chloe Mason is an up-and-coming conceptual artist whose controversial exhibition The Devils Feast has opened both to rave reviews and condemnation. Her work is sexual, political, provocative and blasphemous - and open to a wide range of interpretations. To some critics, she’s the new Picasso, to others her entire exhibition is a load of meaningless crap. But whether Chloe Mason is any good or not is almost immaterial. The question is: what sort of person produces work like this? Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about Chloe and the series of events that have led up to The Devils Feast. We also meet the characters whose lives interact with Chloe, inspiring her artistic output. There’s her best friend, Janet, a single mother who is constantly searching for the right man in all the wrong places, and Sticks, the idealistic editor of a local anarchist magazine who becomes Chloe’s boyfriend. And then there’s Paul the leader of a mysterious religious cult: just what is he up to? Like the exhibition of the title, The Devils Feast tackles head-on such weighty topics as religion, sex and politics, throwing in drugs and violence for good measure. And like Chloe Mason’s work, audiences can interpret this film in different ways: is it a psychological drama or a black comedy? The Devils Feast has an anarchic energy always keeps the viewer guessing! With its complex, multi-stranded story structure, an improvised script, and a gritty realism achieved through the use of hand-held cameras, The Devils Feast straddles the rarely explored middle-ground between Ken Loach and Quentin Tarantino. http://go.to/devilsfeast","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"The_Devils_Feast","subject":["devils feast mischief pictures uk dv movie digital first"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"The Phantom Express","description":"A railroad is plagued by a mystery train, which on dark nights seems to be headed on a collision course with train number 101, stopping or derailing the 101, then disappearing afterward.

An ambitious prosecutor wants publicity. And an outsider - a Northern teacher in a sleepy Southern town - makes a handy defendant, someone the locals will happily convict, innocent or guilty. Based on the infamous Leo Frank case, They Won't Forget is an explosive, acclaimed indictment of bigotry that's rich in deceptive motives, sudden violence and courtroom suspense. The talent is as powerful as the story: Mervyn LeRoy (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang) produced and directed with steady hand and crackling pacing, Robert Rossen (The Hustler) co-wrote the unflinching script, Claude Rains (Casablanca) etches a portrait of the ruthless prosecutor with poison and guile, and in her first credited role, Lana Turner makes the schoolgirl beguiling prey for an unhinged mind.

When I tried to stream, the dialogue went out-of-sync. It might work well with faster broadband. Lost in the Wash tells the story of a filmmaker (Blake Mitchell) who becomes a participant in his own screenplay after his girlfriend breaks up with him. After Blake kills off one of his characters (Lucy), another character (Thomas) blatantly ignoring the boundaries of reality, telephones Blake and demands that Lucy be brought back from the dead. Blake continues to work his way out of this cinematic rabbit hole as a means of discovering where his life went wrong. The harder he tries, however, the more lost he becomes. And the only people who can help him are the ones that he himself invented.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"ArenHaunLostintheWash","subject":["feature, comedy, independent"],"format":["Video","512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"1933 - Deutschland erwacht - Ein Dokument von der Wiedergeburt Deutschlands","description":"1933 - Deutschland erwacht - Ein Dokument von der Wiedergeburt Deutschlands","identifier":"1933-DeutschlandErwacht-EinDokumentVonDerWiedergeburtDeutschlands","subject":["1933","Nazi's","War","Deutschland","Adolf Hitler"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Flash Video","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Crude Impact","description":"<br /><a href=\"http://thoughtmaybe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>thoughtmaybe.com</b></a>","identifier":"CrudeImpact","subject":["peak oil","energy"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Yongary Monster From the Deep","description":"Hosted by The Cinemated Man Directed by Ki-duk Kim Written by Ki-duk Kim, Yun-sung Special Effects by Kenichi Nakagawa","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","identifier":"YongaryMonsterFromTheDeep","subject":["yongary","monster","korean","movie","cinematedman"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films"]},{"title":"1941 - Mein Leben fuer Irland (1h 30m, 640x480)","description":"1941 - Mein Leben fuer Irland (1h 30m, 640x480)","identifier":"1941-Mein-Leben-fuer-Irland","subject":["Irland"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Matroska","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"1934 - Um das Menschenrecht (1h 22m, 640x464)","description":"1934 - Um das Menschenrecht (1h 22m, 640x464)","identifier":"1934-Um-das-Menschenrecht","subject":["Menschenrecht"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Matroska","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Waves Washing the Sand (浪淘沙)","description":"Also known as Gold and Sand/Lang Tao Sha","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":0.0,"identifier":"waves_washing_the_sand","format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG2","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"1939 - Deutsches Land in Afrika (1h 08m, 352x288)","description":"1939 - Deutsches Land in Afrika (1h 08m, 352x288)","identifier":"1939-Deutsches-Land-in-Afrika","subject":["Afrika"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Matroska","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Warriors of the Net in Tamil","description":"This is the tamil version of the video \"Warriors of the Net\" available in www.warriorsofthe.net","identifier":"WarriorsOfTheNetInTamil","subject":["internet","tamil","video","ip"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG1","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"1936 - Heer im Werden (1h 09m, 640x480)","description":"1936 - Heer im Werden (1h 09m, 640x480)","identifier":"1936-Heer-im-Werden","subject":["Heer","Wehrmacht"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Matroska","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"1937 - Patrioten (1h 17m, 640x480)","description":"1937 - Patrioten (1h 17m, 640x480)","avg_rating":3.0,"identifier":"1937-Patrioten","subject":["Patrioten"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Matroska","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Nobody Needs To Know","description":"Young black man about town, \"Lamont\" (Alvin Seme) pushed by the constant surveillance of his everyday life, discovers the real power is offscreen.

Each individual delves into their personal opinions about the impact of hurricane Katrina – a multi-faceted economic, political, ecological, ethical, and social storm.

This movie \"Stone mill\" tell us the true stories about Holodomor. The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомор; translation: murder by hunger) was a famine in the Ukrainian SSR from 1932–1933, during which millions of inhabitants died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine. Estimates on the total number of casualties within Soviet Ukraine range mostly from 2.6 million to 10 million. Primarily as a result of the economic and trade policies instituted by Joseph Stalin, millions of Ukrainians starved to death over the course of a single year. The causes of the famine are a controversial issue and scholars disagree on the relative importance of natural factors, bad economic policies or engineered measures towards Ukrainian peasants.

It takes an anti-censorship stance against censorship and is filled with a healthy base of opinions including facts on the subject matter and arguments. This film can also be considered as a drama/comedy as it is serious in its arguments and opinions, but takes a humorous approach to the subject at hand as well. The film tackles multiple issues within the broad subject of censorship which include the opinion of censorship, the right to think for ones self, the MPAA, regulation, fear, responsibility, violence in media, and education to name a few. It does not completely seal the deal for each subject, but does take a look in to each subject for a fair amount of time.

The story is partly based on two Conan Doyle short stories: \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Empty House\". Sceptical about the potential success of the film, the producers sold the rights to the film to \"First Division Pictures\" for 800 pounds. The film was released in July 1931 under the title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\". It was very successful, running for over a month on Broadway, which was unprecidented for a British produced programmer. Reviews hailed the film for \"bringing the real Sherlock Holmes to the screen.\" This prompted 4 more movies in the series The Missing Rembrandt (still considered lost), <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Sign_OF_Four\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sign of Four</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/The_Triumph_of_Sherlock_Holmes\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Murder_At_The_Baskervilles\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles</a>. This film was deemed lost when the only known print (a 16 mm reduction print of the US version) went missing after being shown at a Sherlock Holmes Society reception for Arthur Wontner in 1955. The version presented here is pieced together from two separate prints to create the longest and best quality version of the film. There are noticable differences between the two prints. The lesser quality print is only used to fill in minor sections that were missing or incomplete in the better quality version. It has the US title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\" on screen. The quality is still not optimal, but it is a major improvement from the versions previously available.","licenseurl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","avg_rating":1.0,"identifier":"TheSleepingCardinal","subject":["Feature Films","Sherlock Holmes","Arthur Wontner","Ian Fleming","The Sleeping Cardinal"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","MPEG4","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["TheVideoCellarCollection","feature_films"]},{"title":"Reciprocal course","description":"Reciprocal course","identifier":"ReciprocalCourse","subject":["Mosfilm","RussTV","USSR"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Cinepack","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"saye jenayat","description":"saye jenayat","identifier":"SayeJenayat","subject":["saye jenayat"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail","Windows Media"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"gonh e man","description":"gonh e man","identifier":"GonhEMan","subject":["gonh e man"],"format":["512Kb MPEG4","Animated GIF","Metadata","Ogg Video","Thumbnail","Windows Media"],"collection":["feature_films"]},{"title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","description":"Mrs Erlynne (Irene Rich), the mother of Lady Windermere (May McAvoy) - her daughter does not know about her - wants to be introduced in society, so that she can marry Lord Augustus Lorton (Edward Martindel).
